These contain abundant research results which extract features and opinions, identify semantic orientation, and associate features with opinions. Although this approach has performed well for English reviews, it is not as successful with Chinese reviews. In this paper, we aim to develop a sentiment analysis system that is suitable for Chinese reviews. This system would extract features that users are interested in and detect those opinions with semantic orientations that accord with the dependency of certain features and opinions in one specific category. We then present users with the integrated results. Our experiments show that the derived system can effectively measure the dependency between features and opinions.

      { "abstract" : "In recent years, sentiment analysis and opinion mining has grown to be one of the most active research areas. Most of the existing researches on feature-level opinion mining are dedicated to extract explicitly appeared features and opinion words. However, among the numerous kinds of reviews on the web, there are a significant number of reviews that contain only opinion words which imply some product features. The identification of such implicit features is still one of the most challenge tasks in opinion mining. In this paper, we propose a classification-based approach to deal with the task of implicit feature identification. Firstly, by exploiting the word segmentation, part-of-speech(POS) tagging and dependency parsing, a rule based method to extract the explicit feature-opinion pairs is presented. Secondly, the feature-opinion pairs for each opinion word are clustered and the training documents for each clustered feature-opinion pair are then constructed. Finally, the identification of implicit features is formulated into a classification-based feature selection. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods significantly.

Moreover, the experimental results indicate that SVM-based feature selection yields the best performance for feature selection and that the SVM classifier outperforms the other techniques for Arabic sentimentbased classification.

In this paper, we present a feature driven opinion summarization method, where the term --driven-- is employed to describe the concept-to-detail (product class to product-specific characteristics) approach we took. For each product class we first automatically extract general features (characteristics describing any product, such as price, size, design), for each product we then extract specific features (as picture resolution in the case of a digital camera) and feature attributes (adjectives grading the characteristics, as for example high or low for price, small or big for size and modern or faddy for design). Further on, we assign a polarity (positive or negative) to each of the feature attributes using a previously annotated corpus and Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization[1] machine learning with the Normalized Google Distance[2]. We show how the method presented is employed to build a feature-driven opinion summarization system that is presently working in English and Spanish.

The raw review text is split into sentences and depending on the product class detected, only the phrases containing the specific product features are selected for further processing. The phrases extracted undergo a process of anaphora resolution, Named Entity Recognition and syntactic parsing. Applying syntactic dependency and part of speech patterns, we extract pairs containing the feature and the polarity of the feature attribute the customer associates to the feature in the review. Eventually, we statistically summarize the polarity of the opinions different customers expressed about the product on the web as percentages of positive and negative opinions about each of the product features.

Specifically, the well known double propagation (DP) method is implemented using 8 ASP rules that naturally model all key ideas in the DP method. Our experiment on a widely used data set also shows that the ASP implementation is much faster than a Java-based implementation. Syntactical approach has its limitation too. To further improve the performance of syntactical approach, we identify a set of general words from WordNet that have little chance to be an aspect and prune them when extracting aspects. The concept of general words and their pruning are concisely captured by 10 new ASP rules, and a natural extension of the 8 rules for the original DP method. Experimental results show a major improvement in precision with almost no drop in recall compared with those reported in the existing work on a typical benchmark data set.

In this paper, we proposed opinion mining method for product reviews. In our approach, we first do POS tagging on each review sentence, and we extract feature and opinion words in form of transaction data. Then we discover association rules of needed type from the transaction data, and provide information that is summarized advantages and disadvantages using PMI-IR algorithm. Copyright ÃÂ© 2009 ACM.",

The extension concerns with the fact that users refer differently to different kinds of products when writing reviews on the Web. Since LiuÃ¢â¬â¢s approach is focused on physical product reviews, it could not be directly applied to the tourism domain, which presents features that are not considered by the model. Through a detailed study of on-line tourism product reviews, we found these features and then model them in our extension, proposing the use of new and more complex NLP-based rules for the tasks of subjective and sentiment classification at the aspect-level. We also entail the task of opinion visualization and summarization and propose new methods to help users digest the vast availability of opinions in an easy manner. Our work also included the development of a generic architecture for an aspect-based opinion mining tool, which we then used to create a prototype and analyze opinions from TripAdvisor in the context of the tourism industry in Los Lagos, a Chilean administrative region also known as the Lake District. Results prove that our extension is able to perform better than LiuÃ¢â¬â¢s model in the tourism domain, improving both Accuracy and Recall for the tasks of subjective and sentiment classification. Particularly, the approach is very effective in determining the sentiment orientation of opinions, achieving an F-measure of 92% for the task. However, on average, the algorithms were only capable of extracting 35% of the explicit aspect expressions, using a non-extended approach for this task. Finally, results also showed the effectiveness of our design when applied to solving the industryÃ¢â¬â¢s specific issues in the Lake District, since almost 80% of the users that used our tool considered that our tool adds valuable information to their business.",

Social media, such as Twitter, are regarded as public diaries, where millions of people express their sentiments and opinions in their daily interaction. One of the biggest challenges in the analysis of such data, is the classification of their polarity, that is, whether they carry a positive or negative connotation. For this purpose, statistical methods have been inspired by the observation that if two words frequently appear together within the same context, they are likely to have the same polarity. Consequently, the polarity of a word can be determined by calculating its relative frequency of co-occurrence with special words, called paradigm words, whose polarities are invariantly preserved (e.g., --good-- and --bad--). In this way, one can classify, for example, a tweet as carrying a positive polarity, if the majority of its words is more strongly associated with the word --good-- than with the word --bad--. In current statistical approaches, such paradigm words have been selected following different criteria, without any prior evaluation. Motivated by this observation, we propose to classify tweets via a statistical method where the paradigm words are selected by means of a genetic algorithm. This algorithm explores a set of paradigm words to find a subset of such words that leads to a significant improvement of the classification accuracy. Additionally, we believe that an appropriate set of paradigm words may vary according to the data domain. For example, paradigm words applied in the classification of tweets in the domain of movies may not be convenient to classify tweets related to products. We prove this assumption empirically, using tweets from different domains, and show that our approach deals properly with this problem.",

There are many feature-based sentiment analysis approaches where features can be the word itself, or its part-of-speech, or some polarity tags. However, the used lexical resources (positive and negative word lists) do not generate accurate opinion extraction results. Another problem in the existing approaches is that the words are processed separately and cannot efficiently solve complex opinion structures (e.g., I do not think it is a bad product). The enhanced feature-based sentiment analysis system in this paper overcomes these limitations and improves the accuracy of opinion extraction. At first, an open source tool called Stanford Parser is employed to stem each word and add the parts-of-speech (POS) tag. Then the lists of positive words, negative words, and other words that can invert, increase or decrease the opinion are built using SentiWordNet. Next, a set of rules is proposed to enrich tags to the words that can invert, increase, or decrease the opinion. The final opinion is determined by aggregating the opinion weights at word-level, sentence-level and document-level. The experimental results show that the new sentiment analysis system achieves the high accuracy of 84%. ISCA",

Marketing or sales people do analysis on their products reach using surveys, feedback and queries etc. using online forms. All these unstructured text and voluminous data have to be analyzed manually or semi-automatically to understand the context and make decisions on the business. Similarly to buy any products online, people usually search and get opinion on the products from friends before taking their decisions. Whenever a new product is launched in the market, the social networking sites are deluged with reviews and comments about the product. We can exploit this to the advantage of determining the reach of the product among the common mass by applying sentiment analysis over these reviews. The use of this is twofold- (i) The seller gets first-hand information about the products reach (ii) Buyer can buy the right product for his need. In this paper, we propose a model to store the product information as ontologies, thereby bringing strong relationships among the data stored. We add more semantics by embedding the opinions, determined using sentiment analysis, within the linked data thereby accounting for better reasoning and efficient querying. We propose a method to perform opinion mining on products by extracting the comments on products features from the reviews posted in a micro-blogging site such as twitter. The sentiment analysis is done on these reviews to rate the product features. These opinions are stored along with the product-feature descriptions in the domain ontology in OWL format. Once the opinions are embedded in the ontology, the model can serve for better reasoning and answering intelligent queries. This information can also be recommended to the people who are in need when they search for similar products which help them to make necessary decisions based on the others opinions.",

And with the feature-sentiment words matrix, the information-theoretic Co-clustering algorithm is used to simultaneously cluster evaluated features and sentiment words.

Before buying any product, one is interested to know the opinion of other people about that product. For any product, there are hundreds of reviews available online so it becomes very difficult for the customers to read all the reviews. Also, one cannot set his mind based on reading some of the review since it gives him a biased view about that product. So we need to automate this process. As we know, there are lots of opinion words present in the sentences of a review which will tell about the polarity of that product. Out of all the opinion words, some words behave in the same manner means they have the same polarity in all contexts, but some words are context dependent means they have different polarity in different context. In this paper, we proposed an Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis and Summarization (ASAS) System, which handles the context dependent opinion words that has been the cause of major difficulties. For finding the opinion polarity, first, we used an online dictionary for classifying the context independent opinion word. Second, we used natural linguistic rules for assigning the polarity to maximum possible context dependent words. These steps create the training data set. Third, for classification of the remaining opinion words, we used opinion words and feature together rather than opinion words alone, because the same opinion word can have different polarity in the same domain. Then we used our Interaction Information method to classify the feature-opinion pairs. Fourth, as negation plays a very crucial role, we found negation words and flipped the polarity of the corresponding opinion word. Finally, after classifying each opinion word, the system generated a short summary for that particular product based on each feature",

      { "abstract" : "--What other people think-- has always been an important piece of information for most of us during the decision-making process. Today people tend to make their opinions available to other people via the Internet. As a result, the Web has become an excellent source of consumer opinions. There are now numerous Web resources containing such opinions, e.g., product reviews forums, discussion groups, and blogs. But, it is really difficult for a customer to read all of the reviews and make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It is also difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and manage customer opinions. Also, focusing on just user ratings (stars) is not a sufficient source of information for a user or the manufacturer to make decisions. Therefore, mining online reviews (opinion mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction. Extracting aspects and the corresponding ratings is an important challenge in opinion mining. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, e.g. zoom for a digital camera. A rating is an intended interpretation of the user satisfaction in terms of numerical values. Reviewers usually express the rating of an aspect by a set of sentiments, e.g. great zoom. In this tutorial we cover opinion mining in online product reviews with the focus on aspect-based opinion mining. This problem is a key task in the area of opinion mining and has attracted a lot of researchers in the information retrieval community recently. Several opinion related information retrieval tasks can benefit from the results of aspect-based opinion mining and therefore it is considered as a fundamental problem. This tutorial covers not only general opinion mining and retrieval tasks, but also state-of-the-art methods, challenges, applications, and also future research directions of aspect-based opinion mining.",

Sentences in review documents contain independent clauses that express different sentiments toward different aspects of a movie. The method adopts a linguistic approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause. The prior sentiment scores of about 32,000 individual words are derived from SentiWordNet with the help of a subjectivity lexicon. Negation is delicately handled.

To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the partially-supervised alignment model, which regards identifying opinion relations as an alignment process. Then, a graph-based co-ranking algorithm is exploited to estimate the confidence of each candidate. Finally, candidates with higher confidence are extracted as opinion targets or opinion words. Compared to previous methods based on the nearest-neighbor rules, our model captures opinion relations more precisely, especially for long-span relations. Compared to syntax-based methods, our word alignment model effectively alleviates the negative effects of parsing errors when dealing with informal online texts. In particular, compared to the traditional unsupervised alignment model, the proposed model obtains better precision because of the usage of partial supervision. In addition, when estimating candidate confidence, we penalize higher-degree vertices in our graph-based co-ranking algorithm to decrease the probability of error generation.

Typically, sentiment classification has been modeled as the problem of training a binary classifier using reviews annotated for positive or negative sentiment. However, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is costly. Applying a sentiment classifier trained using labeled data for a particular domain to classify sentiment of user reviews on a different domain often results in poor performance because words that occur in the train (source) domain might not appear in the test (target) domain. We propose a method to overcome this problem in cross-domain sentiment classification. First, we create a sentiment sensitive distributional thesaurus using labeled data for the source domains and unlabeled data for both source and target domains. Sentiment sensitivity is achieved in the thesaurus by incorporating document level sentiment labels in the context vectors used as the basis for measuring the distributional similarity between words. Next, we use the created thesaurus to expand feature vectors during train and test times in a binary classifier. The proposed method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are comparable with previously proposed cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark data set containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed method on single- and multisource domain adaptation, unsupervised and supervised domain adaptation, and numerous similarity measures for creating the sentiment sensitive thesaurus. Moreover, our comparisons against the SentiWordNet, a lexical resource for word polarity, show that the created sentiment-sensitive thesaurus accurately captures words that express similar s- ntiments.",

In this paper, we focus on a novel aspect of enabling aggregations of assessments of degree to which a given property holds for a given entity (for instance, how touristy is Boston). We present GrainPile, a user interface for extracting from the web, aggregating and quantifying degree assessments of unconstrained topics. The interface provides a variety of functions: a) identification of dimensions of comparison (properties) relevant to a particular entity or set of entities, b) comparisons of like entities on user-specified properties (for example, which university is more prestigious, Yale or Cornell), c) tracing the derived opinions back to their sources (so that the reasons for the opinions can be found). A central contribution in GrainPile is the evaluated demonstration of feasibility of mapping the recognized expressions (such as fairly, very, extremely, and so on) to a common scale of numerical values and aggregating across all the extracted assessments to derive an overall assessment of degree. GrainPiles novel assessment and aggregation of degree expressions is shown to strongly outperform an interpretation-free, co-occurrence based method. Copyright 2006 ACM.",

To train accurate models for automatic evaluation of products from free-text, it is important to distinguish these two kinds of opinions. In this paper we present experiments on detecting general opinions that target a product as a whole, thus, reflect the user sentiments better. The task is different from subjectivity detection, since the goal is to detect generality of an opinion regardless of the rest of the documents being opinionated or not. The task complements feature-based opinion analysis and opinion polarity classification, since it can be applied as a preceding step to both tasks. We show that when used as a classification feature user ratings are not useful in the general opinion detection task.

The method operates similarly to a bigram language model, using bigram terms or backing off to unigrams based on a (degree of) compositionality criterion. The affective ratings for n-gram terms of different orders are estimated via a corpus-based method using distributional semantic similarity metrics between unseen words and a set of seed words.

To achieve good classification document similarity estimation is one of key techniques since classification is executed based on the document similarity. In natural language processing bag-of-words model is used to extract features from documents and term occurrence frequency based value is used as a weight of each features. However, the term weight methodologies usually use predefined models and include some limitations. New approaches to construct feature vectors based on data distribution are desired to achieve high performance of natural language processing. These days many researchers pay attention to deep learning. Deep learning is a new approach to transform raw data to feature vectors using many unlabeled data. This characteristics is desirable to satisfy a previous need. In natural language processing a main aim is to construct a language model on a deep architecture neural network. In this paper we use a deep architecture neural network to estimate document similarity. To obtain good article similarity estimation we have to generate good article vectors that can represent all article characteristics. Hence, we use many stock market news to train the deep architecture neural network and generate article vectors with the trained neural network. And we calculate cosine similarity between labeled articles and discuss performance of the deep architecture neural network. In evaluation we do not focus on articles contents but on their sentiment polarity. Hence, we discuss whether the proposed method classifies articles according to their sentiment polarity or not. We confirmed though the proposed method is an unsupervised learning approach, it achieves good performance in stock market news similarity estimation.

Decisions over audiovisual encoding are related to the perceived quality of experience (QoE), but also to the physical attributes of initial material (i.e. resolution, color range, motion activity, audio dynamic range, bandwidth, etc.). Recent research showed that such decisions can be really crucial during the production of audiovisual e-learning material, where poor encoding may lead to unaccepted QoE or even to the creation of negative emotional response. On the other hand, exaggerated high quality encoding may create increased bandwidth demands that are associated with annoying delays and irregular playback flow, resulting again in QoE degradation with similar emotional repulsion.

We believe that the analysis of a sentence on the basis of grammatical dependencies among the words is very useful for application such as opinion mining (OM) from a domain specific free format product reviews. Such free format reviews are largely available on Web due to presence of many e-commerce sites. Because of unavailability of universal resources (e.g. opinion word lexicon and feature corpus) for all application domains, OM becomes a very challenging job. OM from free format product reviews mainly deals with extraction of domain specific features, identification of opinion words corresponding to each features and determination of semantic orientation (SO) of opinion of words (e.g. large, small, loud, etc), which does not belong to set prior polarity opinion words (e.g. beautiful, excellent, good, etc.). In this paper, we discuss the role of BGDs among the words of a sentence for opinion mining and explore many BGDs that can directly facilitate the OM.",

We introduce two important and text-related techniques for this purpose namely sentiment classification and semantic Web technology. Sentiment analysis extracts people's opinions in an automatic manner, while semantic Web technology provides a useful improvement by enriching data with additional meaning (semantically annotated) and makes product features better understood by human and automatically processed by machines. For evaluation, we apply our sentiment analysis method twice. Once on a plain corpus, and once again on the same corpus after applying semantic annotation to its data. We also compute the precision and recall principles to evaluate our information extraction method over the corpus in its both cases.",

The combination of online learning with sparsity-inducing regularization enables faster learning with a smaller memory space than the previous learning frameworks. Many optimization methods and learning algorithms have been developed on the basis of online learning with L 1-regularization. L 1-regularization tends to truncate some types of parameters, such as those that rarely occur or have a small range of values, unless they are emphasized in advance. However, the inclusion of a pre-processing step would make it very difficult to preserve the advantages of online learning. We propose a new regularization framework for sparse online learning. We focus on regularization terms, and we enhance the state-of-the-art regularization approach by integrating information on all previous subgradients of the loss function into a regularization term. The resulting algorithms enable online learning to adjust the intensity of each features truncations without pre-processing and eventually eliminate the bias of L 1-regularization.

The mass involved in the process of creating Web content has led many public and private organizations to focus their attention on analyzing this content in order to ascertain the general publicÃ¢â¬â¢s opinions as regards a number of topics. Given the current Web size and growth rate, automated techniques are essential if practical and scalable solutions are to be obtained. Opinion mining is a highly active research field that comprises natural language processing, computational linguistics and text analysis techniques with the aim of extracting various kinds of added-value and informational elements from usersÃ¢â¬â¢ opinions. However, current opinion mining approaches are hampered by a number of drawbacks such as the absence of semantic relations between concepts in feature search processes or the lack of advanced mathematical methods in sentiment analysis processes. In this paper we propose an innovative opinion mining methodology that takes advantage of new Semantic Web-guided solutions to enhance the results obtained with traditional natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis processes. The main goals of the proposed methodology are: (1) to improve feature-based opinion mining by using ontologies at the feature selection stage, and (2) to provide a new vector analysis-based method for sentiment analysis.

To accommodate a wide range of possible applications, this paper presents (i) an adaptive method, balancing accuracy and scalability of multilingual textual sources, (ii) a generic approach for generating language- specific grammar patterns and multilingual tagged dictionaries, and (iii) an extensive evaluation verifying the methods performance based on Amazon product reviews and user evaluations from Sentiment Quiz, a game with a purpose that invites users of the Facebook social networking platform to assess the sentiment of individual sentences.",

Understanding the emotional impacts of participation on patients and their informal caregivers is important for OHC managers. Ethnographical observations, interviews, and questionnaires have reported benefits from online health communities, but these approaches are too costly to adopt for large-scale analyses of emotional impacts. A computational approach using machine learning and text mining techniques is demonstrated using data from the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online forum of nearly a half million posts. This approach automatically estimates the sentiment of forum posts, discovers sentiment change patterns in CSN members, and allows investigation of factors that affect the sentiment change. This first study of sentiment benefits and dynamics in a large-scale health-related electronic community finds that an estimated 75%-85% of CSN forum participants change their sentiment in a positive direction through online interactions with other community members. Two new features, Name and Slang, not previously used in sentiment analysis, facilitate identifying positive sentiment in posts. This work establishes foundational concepts for further studies of sentiment impact of OHC participation and provides insight useful for the design of new OHCs or enhancement of existing OHCs in providing better emotional support to their members.",

This capability enables them to bring excelling engagements to a faster close, and identify and help troubled engagements. As a related problem, service providers are interested in understanding the win chances of engagements in order to prioritize their pipelines for planning and resource management purposes.

(2) Which aspects of the service system facilitate the co-creation of value-in-context as perceived by the customer? An experiment was carried out with a group of habitual bus travelers to plan a specific journey using two online journey planning systems, one representing a GDL informed service and the other SDL. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered regarding the subjects perceived experiences with the two systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify opinion features from online reviews by exploiting the difference in opinion feature statistics across two corpora, one domain-specific corpus (i.e., the given review corpus) and one domain-independent corpus (i.e., the contrasting corpus). We capture this disparity via a measure called domain relevance (DR), which characterizes the relevance of a term to a text collection. We first extract a list of candidate opinion features from the domain review corpus by defining a set of syntactic dependence rules. For each extracted candidate feature, we then estimate its intrinsic-domain relevance (IDR) and extrinsic-domain relevance (EDR) scores on the domain-dependent and domain-independent corpora, respectively. Candidate features that are less generic (EDR score less than a threshold) and more domain-specific (IDR score greater than another threshold) are then confirmed as opinion features. We call this interval thresholding approach the intrinsic and extrinsic domain relevance (IEDR) criterion. Experimental results on two real-world review domains show the proposed IEDR approach to outperform several other well-established methods in identifying opinion features. ÃÂ© 2014 IEEE.",

Thus, aspect-based opinion mining and summarization are of great interest in academic and industrial research. In this paper, we study an approach to extract product and service aspect words, as well as sentiment words, automatically from reviews. An unsupervised dependency analysis-based approach is presented to extract Appraisal Expression Patterns (AEPs) from reviews, which represent the manner in which people express opinions regarding products or services and can be regarded as a condensed representation of the syntactic relationship between aspect and sentiment words. {AEPs} are high-level, domain-independent types of information, and have excellent domain adaptability. An AEP-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (AEP-LDA) model is also proposed. This is a sentence-level, probabilistic generative model which assumes that all words in a sentence are drawn from one topic Ã¢â¬ a generally true assumption, based on our observation. The model also assumes that every review corpus is composed of several mutually corresponding aspect and sentiment topics, as well as a background word topic. The {AEP} information is incorporated into the AEP-LDA model for mining aspect and sentiment words simultaneously.

A large number of tweets and customer surveys include opinions about products and services. However, with Twitter being a relatively new phenomenon, these tweets are underutilized as a source for determining customer sentiments. To explore high-volume customer feedback streams, we integrate three time series-based visual analysis techniques: (1) feature-based sentiment analysis that extracts, measures, and maps customer feedback:, (2) a novel idea of term associations that identify attributes, verbs, and adjectives frequently occurring together:, and (3) new pixel cell-based sentiment calendars, geo-temporal map visualizations and self-organizing maps to identify co-occurring and influential opinions. We have combined these techniques into a well-fitted solution for an effective analysis of large customer feedback streams such as for movie reviews (e.g., Kung-Fu Panda) or web surveys (buyers).

Although many methods for multilingual sentiment analysis have been developed in the open literature, most of them suffer from two major problems. The first is their excessive dependence on external tools or resources (e.g., Machine translation systems or bilingual dictionaries), which may not be readily obtained, especially for minority languages, The second is conflictive sentiments, i.e., The sentiment polarity of some parts of a text is inconsistent with its overall sentiment polarity. It is observed that in a product or service review there usually exist a few sentences which play a more important role in determining its sentiment polarity, as compared to others. Therefore, differentiating key sentences from trivial ones may be helpful to improve sentiment analysis. Inspired by this observation in this paper we propose a novel framework to estimate the sentiment polarity of reviews by virtue of opinion lexica and key sentences automatically extracted from unlabelled data. This framework cannot only overcome the problem of excessive dependence on external resources, but also is able to capture the overall sentiment polarity of reviews.

Yet, the ever-growing amount of data in different languages on the Web renders multi-lingual support increasingly important. In this paper, we assess various methods for supporting an additional target language in lexicon-based sentiment analysis. As a baseline, we automatically translate text into a reference language for which a sentiment lexicon is available, and subsequently analyze the translated text. Second, we consider mapping sentiment scores from a semantically enabled sentiment lexicon in the reference language to a new target sentiment lexicon, by traversing relations between language-specific semantic lexicons. Last, we consider creating a target sentiment lexicon by propagating sentiment of seed words in a semantic lexicon for the target language. When extending sentiment analysis from English to Dutch, mapping sentiment across languages by exploiting relations between semantic lexicons yields a significant performance improvement over the baseline of about 29% in terms of accuracy and macro-level {F1} on our data. Propagating sentiment in language-specific semantic lexicons can outperform the baseline by up to about 47%, depending on the seed set of sentiment-carrying words.

Identifying features associated with opinions expressed in reviews is essential for fine-grained opinion mining. One approach is to exploit the dependency relations that occur naturally between features and opinion words, and among features (or opinion words) themselves. In this paper, we propose a generalized approach to opinion feature extraction by incorporating robust statistical association analysis in a bootstrapping framework. The new approach starts with a small set of feature seeds, on which it iteratively enlarges by mining feature-opinion, feature-feature, and opinion-opinion dependency relations. Two association model types, namely likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and latent semantic analysis (LSA), are proposed for computing the pair-wise associations between terms (features or opinions). We accordingly propose two robust bootstrapping approaches, LRTBOOT and LSABOOT, both of which need just a handful of initial feature seeds to bootstrap opinion feature extraction. We benchmarked LRTBOOT and LSABOOT against existing approaches on a large number of real-life reviews crawled from the cellphone and hotel domains. Experimental results using varying number of feature seeds show that the proposed association-based bootstrapping approach significantly outperforms the competitors. In fact, one seed feature is all that is needed for LRTBOOT to significantly outperform the other methods. This seed feature can simply be the domain feature, e.g., --cellphone-- or --hotel--. The consequence of our discovery is far reaching: starting with just one feature seed, typically just the domain concept word, LRTBOOT can automatically extract a large set of high-quality opinion features from the corpus without any supervision or labeled features. This means that the automatic creation of a set of domain features is no longer a pipe dream! ÃÂ© 2012 ACM.",

The latter is termed as the relationship strength and marked at three levels-weak, medium and strong. We have previously reported a preliminary study on this issue [22], and here we detail our studies on constructing a novel feature space towards effectively predicting the polarity and strength of a relationship. Unlike previous work, four types of polarity instead of three are considered, namely, positive, negative, neutral and norelationship. Another contribution is that in addition to the commonly accepted lexicon-based features, we have identified a set of novel features that capture both the semantic and structural aspects of a relationship. Our intensive evaluations demonstrate that combining these new features with the lexicon-based ones can achieve the best accuracy for polarity prediction (Ã¢ËÂ¼0.91).

      { "abstract" : "Abstract One of the most challenging problems in aspect-based opinion mining is aspect extraction, which aims to identify expressions that describe aspects of products (called aspect expressions) and categorize domain-specific synonymous expressions. Although a number of methods of aspect extraction have been proposed before, very few of them are designed to improve the interpretability of generated aspects. Existing methods either generate multiple fine-grained aspects without proper categorization or categorize semantically unrelated product aspects (e.g., by unsupervised topic modeling). In this paper, we first examine previous studies on product aspect extraction. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, two novel semi-supervised models for product aspect extraction are then proposed. More specifically, the proposed methodology first extracts seeding aspects and related terms from detailed product descriptions readily available on E-commerce websites. Next, product reviews are regrouped according to these seeding aspects so that more effective textual contexts for topic modeling are built. Finally, two novel semi-supervised topic models are developed to extract human-comprehensible product aspects. For the first proposed topic model, the Fine-grained Labeled {LDA} (FL-LDA), seeding aspects are applied to guide the model to discover words that are related to these seeding aspects. For the second model, the Unified Fine-grained Labeled {LDA} (UFL-LDA), we incorporate unlabeled documents to extend the FL-LDA model so that words related to the seeding aspects or other high-frequency words in customer reviews are extracted. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods.",

These opinions and feedbacks are very important for the organizations that are selling or manufacturing the products, which can be used for changing designs, personalization and better understanding of product. This information is very useful for people or customer for buying the product. But for a customer, it is very difficult to review all the opinions or feedbacks available on net for a particular product. So, data mining approaches are used to mine the opinions, perform summarization of reviews for a particular product based on features or any other category.

Aspect-based opinion mining technique has been employed to find out reviewers opinions toward different product aspects. Such finer-grained opinion mining is valuable for the potential customers to make their purchase decisions. Product-feature extraction and categorization is very important for better mining aspect-oriented opinions. Since people usually use different words to describe the same aspect in the reviews, product-feature extraction and categorization becomes more challenging. Manually product-feature extraction and categorization is tedious and time consuming, and practically infeasible for the massive amount of products. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised product-feature categorization method with multilevel latent semantic association. After extracting product-features from the semi-structured reviews, we construct the first latent semantic association (LaSA) model to group words into a set of concepts according to their virtual context documents. It generates the latent semantic structure for each product-feature. The second LaSA model is constructed to categorize the product-features according to their latent semantic structures and context snippets in the reviews.

The subjectivity classification system uses Genetic-Based Machine Learning (GBML) technique that considers subjectivity as a semantic problem. The classification of a review is predicted through the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. Experimental results of the proposed techniques are efficient and generate eminent evaluations.",

However, a word can exhibit different polarities in different contexts, which are termed as contextual polarities. In this paper, viewing polarities of words as properties of word senses, we treat the Chinese contextual polarity classification as word sense disambiguation (WSD), and manually labeled a Chinese dataset for training and testing. Due to the insufficiency of labeled data, semi-supervised methods are adopted:, to find the effective features for the contextual polarity classification, two automatic feature selection algorithms are proposed. We combine the semi-supervised methods with automatic feature selection algorithms in order to utilize the strengths of both.

The sentence parser can be used to identify the adjectives what the authors used in their discussion about the cited paper. Then the identified adjectives can be assigned a score to distinguish it from positive and negative. In between, if any paper is found without clearly mentioning the cited paper with identifiable adjective terms then in can be named as unknown or neutral.

One of the challenges of Persian language is using of a wide variety of declensional suffixes. Another common problem of Persian text is word spacing. In Persian in addition to white space as interwords space, an intra-word space called pseudo-space separates words part. One more noticeable challenge in customer reviews in Persian language is that of utilizing many informal or colloquial words in text.

The typical text categorization criterions comprise categorization by topic, by style (genre classification, authorship identification), by expressed opinion (opinion mining, sentiment classification), etc. Very few approaches consider the problem of categorizing text by degree of coherence. One example of application of text categorization by its coherence is creating a spam filter for personal e-mail accounts able to cope with one of the new strategies adopted by spamers. This strategy consists of encoding the real message as picture (impossible to directly analyze and reject by the text oriented classical filters) and accompanying it by a text especially designed to surpass the filter. An important question for automatically categorizing texts into coherent and incoherent is: are there features that can be extracted from these texts and be successfully used to categorize them? We propose a quantitative approach that relies on the use of ratios between morphological categories from the texts as discriminant features.

Consumer-generated product reviews have become a valuable source of information for customers, who read the reviews and decide whether to buy the product based on the information provided. In this paper, we use techniques that decompose the reviews into segments that evaluate the individual characteristics of a product (e.g., image quality and battery life for a digital camera). Then, as a major contribution of this paper, we adapt methods from the econometrics literature, specifically the hedonic regression concept, to estimate: (a) the weight that customers place on each individual product feature, (b) the implicit evaluation score that customers assign to each feature, and (c) how these evaluations affect the revenue for a given product. Towards this goal, we develop a novel hybrid technique combining text mining and econometrics that models consumer product reviews as elements in a tensor product of feature and evaluation spaces. We then impute the quantitative impact of consumer reviews on product demand as a linear functional from this tensor product space. We demonstrate how to use a low-dimension approximation of this functional to significantly reduce the number of model parameters, while still providing good experimental results. We evaluate our technique using a data set from Amazon.com consisting of sales data and the related consumer reviews posted over a 15-month period for 242 products.

USNews.com ranks medical institutions each year and publishes the data through its site. Here, the rankings are determined based on the information generated offline, based on the ranking criteria determined by a specific group, in order to provide the applicable information. Consequently, the rankings perceived by the patients who actually visit the medical institutions may be somewhat different from the rankings provided by USNews.com. For this paper the social information related to medical institutions was crawled from the SNS sites in order to rank the medical institutions based on the information generated by many users in the social media, and these rankings were compared to the ranking results provided by USNews.com. The data used for the experiment comprised the basic information on the 892 medical institutions crawled from USNews.com and the social information crawled from the SNS sites. Social information was available for only 443 institutions. The rankings were computed for these institutions based on the method proposed in this paper, so as to compare to the existing results.

In this paper, we aim to develop methods for ranking estates based on investment values by mining users opinions about estates from online user reviews and offline moving behaviors (e.g., Taxi traces, smart card transactions, check-ins). While a variety of features could be extracted from these data, these features are Interco related and redundant. Thus, selecting good features and integrating the feature selection into the fitting of a ranking model are essential. To this end, in this paper, we first strategically mine the fine-grained discrminative features from user reviews and moving behaviors, and then propose a probabilistic sparse pair wise ranking method for estates. Specifically, we first extract the explicit features from online user reviews which express users opinions about point of interests (POIs) near an estate. We also mine the implicit features from offline moving behaviors from multiple perspectives (e.g., Direction, volume, velocity, heterogeneity, topic, popularity, etc.). Then we learn an estate ranking predictor by combining a pair wise ranking objective and a sparsity regularization in a unified probabilistic framework. And we develop an effective solution for the optimization problem.

Most existing approaches only find individual features of a product without the structural relationships between the features which usually exists.

The extracted reviews are filtered basically according to some rules to remove meaningless symbols. At last, all reviews are segmented into feature-opinion sentences for continual processing. In opinion summarization, FOOSA uses feature-opinion pairs as keys to construct feature-opinion (FO) buckets. Then we use inter bucket reducing method based on information entropy to remove duplicated sentences in different buckets.

      { "abstract" : "Aspect-based opinion mining from online reviews has attracted a lot of attention recently. The main goal of all of the proposed methods is extracting aspects and/or estimating aspect ratings. Recent works, which are often based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), consider both tasks simultaneously. These models are normally trained at the item level, i.e., a model is learned for each item separately. Learning a model per item is fine when the item has been reviewed extensively and has enough training data. However, in reallife datasets such as those from Epinions.com and Amazon.com more than 90% of items have less than 10 reviews, so-called cold start items. State-of-the-art LDA models for aspect-based opinion mining are trained at the item level and therefore perform poorly for cold start items due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model based on LDA, called Factorized LDA (FLDA), to address the cold start problem. The underlying assumption of FLDA is that aspects and ratings of a review are influenced not only by the item but also by the reviewer. It further assumes that both items and reviewers can be modeled by a set of latent factors which represent their aspect and rating distributions. Different from state-of-the-art LDA models, FLDA is trained at the category level and learns the latent factors using the reviews of all the items of a category, in particular the non cold start items, and uses them as prior for cold start items. Our experiments on three real-life datasets demonstrate the improved effectiveness of the FLDA model in terms of likelihood of the held-out test set. We also evaluate the accuracy of FLDA based on two application-oriented measures. Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).",

A domain vector is derived based on the association values between a feature and comparative domain corpora. A novel term similarity measure (PMIÃ¢â¬TFIDF) is introduced to evaluate the association of candidate features and domain entities. The results show that our approach of feature extraction outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and the only external resources used are comparative domain corpora. Therefore, it is generic and unsupervised. Compared with traditional pointwise mutual information (PMI), PMIÃ¢â¬TFIDF showed better distinction ability. We also propose feature-oriented opinion determination based on feature-opinion pair extraction and feature-oriented opinion lexicon generation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and indicate that feature-oriented opinion lexicons are superior to general opinion lexicons for feature-oriented opinion determination.",

      { "abstract" : "The prevalence of Web2.0 makes the Web an invaluable source of information. For instance, product reviews composed collaboratively by many independent Internet reviewers can help consumers make purchase decisions and enable manufactures to improve their business strategies. As the number of reviews is increasing exponentially, opinion mining is needed to identify important reviews and opinions for users. Most opinion mining approaches try to extract sentimental or bipolar expressions from a large volume of reviews. However, the mining process often ignores the quality of each review and may retrieve useless or even noisy reviews. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the quality of information in product reviews. We treat review quality evaluation as a classification problem and employ an effective information quality framework to extract representative review features. Experiments based on an expert-composed data corpus demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly. ÃÂ© 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",

      { "abstract" : "A traditional market survey typically seeks out customers' opinions using voluntary questionnaires or focus group interviews. The surveys' perceived and actual reliability could be limited by the number of customers who choose to respond, bias inherent in the wording of the questions or the subjects' interpretation regarding the information being sought. Online opinion resources such as review sites, forums, discussion groups and blogs are available with increasing variety and popularity. Companies can now apply information retrieval, natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically and more objectively identify and understand the opinions of their customers. In this paper, we present an approach to analyze customers' opinions regarding the hotels in Thailand. Such results can be used to determine public perceptions regarding selected hotels in order to allow the business to better understand customer satisfaction.",

The main result of our work is a new method of aspect-based sentiment analysis based on the distributed representations of words. Such representations are obtained by using deep learning algorithms. The method includes the well-known algorithm of training distributed representations of words, two new techniques for constructing the aspect and sentiment lexicons, and an algorithm for calculating aspect scores. Examples of aspect and sentiment terms are given. The vectors of resulting terms are visualized using the t-SNE method. The article presents the results of experiments on a test corpus for three aspects-'food', 'interior' and 'service', which yield aF1-measure increase of 11 to 16% as compared to the baseline.",

Our research is focused on the creation of EmotiBlog, a fine-grained annotation scheme for labelling subjectivity in non-traditional textual genres. We also present the EmotiBlog corpus:, a collection of blog posts composed by 270,000 tokens about 3 topics and in 3 languages: Spanish, English and Italian. Additionally, we carry out a series of experiments focused on checking the robustness of the model and its applicability to Natural Language Processing tasks with regards to the 3 languages. The experiments for the inter-annotator agreement, as well as for feature selection, provided satisfactory results, which have given an impetus to continue working with the model and extend the annotated corpus. In order to check its applicability, we tested different Machine Learning models created using the annotation in EmotiBlog on other corpora in order to see if the obtained annotation is domain and genre independent, obtaining positive results. Finally, we also applied EmotiBlog to Opinion Mining, proving that our resource allows an improvement the performance of systems built for this task. ÃÂ© 2012 The Author(s).",

People share their thoughts regarding a wide range of products, their features, and the service they received. In addition, more than 190 million tweets (small text Web posts) are generated daily. Both survey feedback and tweets are underutilized as a source for understanding customer sentiments. To explore high-volume customer feedback streams, in this article, we introduce four time series visual analysis techniques: (1) feature-based sentiment analysis that extracts, measures, and maps customer feedback:, (2) a novel way of determining term associations that identify attributes, verbs, and adjectives frequently occurring together:, (3) a self-organizing term association map and a pixel cell-based sentiment calendar to identify co-occurring and influential opinion:, and (4) a new geo-based term association technique providing a key term geo map to enable the user to inspect the statistical significance and the sentiment distribution of individual key terms. We have used and evaluated these techniques and combined them into a well-fitted solution for an effective analysis of large customer feedback streams such as web surveys (from product buyers) and Twitter (e.g. from Kung-Fu Panda movie reviewers).

In recent years, more and more people express their opinions about products online, and both the feedback of manufacturersÃ¢â¬â¢ products or their competitorsÃ¢â¬â¢ products could be easily collected. However, itÃ¢â¬â¢s impossible for manufacturers to read every review to analyze the weakness of their products. Therefore, finding product weakness from online reviews becomes a meaningful work. In this paper, we introduce such an expert system, Weakness Finder, which can help manufacturers find their product weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure, and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customersÃ¢â¬â¢ reviews, or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitorÃ¢â¬â¢s product reviews. Weakness Finder has been used to help a body wash manufacturer find their product weakness, and our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the Weakness Finder.",

Thus, techniques for personalization and shopping assistance are in high demand by users, as well as by shopping platforms themselves. For a pleasant and successful shopping experience, users should be empowered to easily decide on which products to buy with high confidence. However, especially for entertainment goods like e.g. movies, books, or music, this task is very challenging. Unfortunately, to days approaches for dealing with this challenge (like e.g. recommender systems) suffer severe drawbacks: recommender systems are completely opaque, i.e. the recommendation is hard to justify semantically. User reviews could help users to form an opinion of recommended items, but with several thousand reviews available for e.g. a given popular movie, it is very challenging for users to find representative reviews. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for automatically analyzing user reviews using advanced opinion mining techniques. The results of this analysis are then used to group reviews by their semantics, i.e. by their contained opinions and point-of-views. Furthermore, the relevant paragraphs with respect to each opinion is extracted and presented to the user. These extracts can easily be digested by users to allow them a quick and diverse forming of opinion, and thus increasing their confidence in their decision, and their overall customer satisfaction.",
