1001;A CATEGORIZED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF CHINESE REVIEWS BY MINING DEPENDENCY IN PRODUCT FEATURES AND OPINIONS FROM BLOGS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Kao, H.-Y. and Lin, Z.-Y.;2010;In the past, there have been many documents focusing on English reviews for sentiment analysis. These contain abundant research results which extract features and opinions, identify semantic orientation, and associate features with opinions. Although this approach has performed well for English reviews, it is not as successful with Chinese reviews. In this paper, we aim to develop a sentiment analysis system that is suitable for Chinese reviews. This system would extract features that users are interested in and detect those opinions with semantic orientations that accord with the dependency of certain features and opinions in one specific category. We then present users with the integrated results. Our experiments show that the derived system can effectively measure the dependency between features and opinions. The prominent performance of review sentiment analysis also validates the applicability of the proposed method.

1002;A CLASSIFICATION-BASED APPROACH FOR IMPLICIT FEATURE IDENTIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Zeng, L. and Li, F.;2013;In recent years, sentiment analysis and opinion mining has grown to be one of the most active research areas. Most of the existing researches on feature-level opinion mining are dedicated to extract explicitly appeared features and opinion words. However, among the numerous kinds of reviews on the web, there are a significant number of reviews that contain only opinion words which imply some product features. The identification of such implicit features is still one of the most challenge tasks in opinion mining. In this paper, we propose a classification-based approach to deal with the task of implicit feature identification. Firstly, by exploiting the word segmentation, part-of-speech(POS) tagging and dependency parsing, a rule based method to extract the explicit feature-opinion pairs is presented. Secondly, the feature-opinion pairs for each opinion word are clustered and the training documents for each clustered feature-opinion pair are then constructed. Finally, the identification of implicit features is formulated into a classification-based feature selection. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods significantly.

1003;A COLLABORATIVE FILTERING APPROACH BASED ON USERS REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;DAddio, R.M. and Garcia Manzato, M.;2014;This paper proposes a collaborative filtering approach that uses users reviews to produce item descriptions that represent a consensus of users regarding items features. While earlier works focused on using structured metadata to represent items, recent approaches study how to use user-provided text, such as reviews, to produce better insights about the semantics in the content. Some involved problems, such as noise, personal opinions and false information are reduced by an algorithm based on sentiment analysis and natural language processing. We provide an evaluation using the MovieLens dataset, and the results are promising when compared to recommenders based only on structured metadata.;Intelligent Systems (BRACIS), 2014 Brazilian Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;204-209;10.1109/BRACIS.2014.45;NULO;Excluir
1004;A COMBINATION METHOD OF CRF WITH SYNTACTIC RULES TO IDENTIFY OPINION-HOLDER;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Kuang, Y.a  and Zhou, Y.a  and He, H.b;2010;This paper presents another aspect of sentiment analysis: identifying opinion-holder in the opinionated sentences. To extract opinion-holder, we firstly explore Conditional Random Field(CRF) based on six features including contextual, opinionated-trigger words, POS tags, named entity, dependency and proposed sentence structure feature, and dependency is adjusted to be better helpful for containing contextual dependency information. Then we propose two novel syntactic rules with opinionated-trigger words to directly identify opinion-holder from the parse trees. The results show that the precision from CRF is much higher than that of syntactic rules, while the recall is lower than. So we combine CRF with syntactic rules used as additional three features including HolderNode, ChunkPosition and Paths for the CRF to train our model. The combination results of the system illustrate the higher recall and higher F-measure under the almost same high precision.

1005;A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FEATURE SELECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR ARABIC SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Omar, N. and Albared, M. and Al-Moslmi, T. and Al-Shabi, A.;2014;Sentiment analysis is a very challenging and important task that involves natural language processing, web mining, and machine learning. Sentiment analysis in the Arabic language is a more challenging task than in other languages due to the morphological complexity of the Arabic and the large variation of its dialects. This paper presents an empirical comparison of seven feature selection methods (Information Gain, Principal Components Analysis, Relief-F, Gini Index, Uncertainty, Chi-squared, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)), and three machine learning classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbor) for Arabic sentiment classification. A wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on an opinion corpus for Arabic (OCA). This paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of Arabic sentiment-based classification, but the result depends on the method used and the number of features selected. The experimental results demonstrate that feature reduction methods are found to improve the classifier performance. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that SVM-based feature selection yields the best performance for feature selection and that the SVM classifier outperforms the other techniques for Arabic sentimentbased classification. Finally, the experiments indicate that the SVM classifier with the SVM-based feature selection method yields the best classification method, with an accuracy of 92.4%.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Article;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84912098458&partnerID=40&md5=a20f0cf8be13cb179dff0b5385585f03;8870;429-443;NULO;NULO;Excluir
1006;A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FEATURE SELECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS FOR SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION ON MOVIE DATA SET;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Selvi, C. and Ahuja, C. and Sivasankar, E.;2015;Sentiment analysis has become a leading research domain with the advent of Web 2.0 where Web users express their opinions in user forums, blogs, discussion boards, and review sites. The online information is considered to be a valuable source for decision making, improving the quality of service, and helping the service providers to enhance their competitiveness. Since the processing of high-dimensional text data is not scalable, different feature selection mechanisms are being used to confine the study to only most informative features. These features are then used to train the classifier to improve the accuracy of sentiment-based classification. This paper explores six feature selection mechanisms (IG, GR, CHI, OneR, Relief-F, and SAE) with five different machine learning classifiers (SVM, NB, DT, K-NN, and ME) thereby providing Accuracy, on the movie review data set for each. Comparative results show that Naive Bayes (NB) outperforms other classifiers and works better for Gain Ratio (GR) and Significance Attribute Evaluation (SAE) feature selection method.;Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing;Article;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84924058158&partnerID=40&md5=71511599542993d7178a528e105e234f;343;367-379;10.1007/978-81-322-2268-2_39;NULO;Excluir
1007;A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SELECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Sharma, A. and Dey, S.;2012;Sentiment analysis is performed to extract opinion and subjectivity knowledge from user generated text content. This is contextually different from traditional topic based text classification since it involves classifying opinionated text according to the sentiment conveyed by it. Feature selection is a critical task in sentiment analysis and effectively selected representative features from subjective text can improve sentiment based classification. This paper explores the applicability of five commonly used feature selection methods in data mining research (DF, IG, GR, CHI and Relief-F) and seven machine learning based classification techniques (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Winnow, Adaboost) for sentiment analysis on online movie reviews dataset. The paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of sentiment based classification, but it depends on the method adopted and the number of feature selected. The experimental results presented in this paper show that Gain Ratio gives the best performance for sentimental feature selection, and SVM performs better than other techniques for sentiment based classification.

1008;A COMPARISON STUDY OF MULTI-CLASS SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR CHINESE REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Zhang, D.a  b  and Li, S.a  and Zhu, C.b  and Niu, X.a  b  and Song, L.a;2010;Most of the previous researches on sentiment analysis concentrate on the binary distinction of positive vs. negative. This paper presents the multi-class sentiment classification problem that attempt to mine the implied rating information from reviews. We use four machine learning methods and two feature selection methods to find out whether or not the multi-class sentiment classification problem is the same to the binary sentiment classification problem, and whether it is equal to the traditional multi-class classification problem. Experiments show that multi-class sentiment classification problem is difficult than that of only determining the polarity of a review and that it is different from traditional multi-class classification problem, thus traditional multi-class classification method can not be directly used to deal with this problem.

1009;A CONTEXT-DEPENDENT SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS BASED ON DEPENDENCY RELATIONSHIPS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Yan, Z.a  and Xing, M.a  and Zhang, D.b  and Ma, B.a  and Wang, T.c;2014;Consumers often view online consumer product review as a main channel for obtaining product quality information. Existing studies on product review sentiment analysis usually focus on identifying sentiments of individual reviews as a whole, which may not be effective and helpful for consumers when purchase decisions depend on specific features of products. This study proposes a new feature-level sentiment analysis approach for online product reviews. The proposed method uses an extended PageRank algorithm to extract product features and construct expandable context-dependent sentiment lexicons. Moreover, consumers sentiment inclinations toward product features expressed in each review can be derived based on term dependency relationships. The empirical evaluation using consumer reviews of two different products shows a higher level of effectiveness of the proposed method for sentiment analysis in comparison to two existing methods. This study provides new research and practical insights on the analysis of online consumer product reviews.;35th International Conference on Information Systems --Building a Better World Through Information Systems--, ICIS 2014;Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84923481372&partnerID=40&md5=8774ead61c9e7d4656a6b5b6f6ecf500;NULO;NULO;NULO;NULO;Incluir

1011;A DISTANT SUPERVISION METHOD FOR PRODUCT ASPECT EXTRACTION FROM CUSTOMER REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Bross, J.;2013;In this paper, we describe a distant supervision approach for the task of detecting product aspect mentions in customer reviews (e.g., in hotel reviews, we want to associate the aspect "sleep quality to a sentence such as We both slept like rocks.). Detecting such aspects represents an important subtask of aspect-oriented review mining systems, which aim at automatically generating structured summaries of customer opinions. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it allows for the high accuracy of a supervised approach and at the same time avoids the costs of manually labeling a training set. We show how to exploit the inherent structure of customer reviews to automatically gather large amounts of labeled data. Our experimental results show that the method achieves a performance as good as a traditional, fully supervised approach.

1012;A FEATURE DEPENDENT METHOD FOR OPINION MINING AND CLASSIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Balahur, A. and Montoyo, A.;2008;Mining the web for customer opinion on different products is both a useful, as well as challenging task. Previous approaches to customer review classification included document level, sentence and clause level sentiment analysis and feature based opinion summarization. In this paper, we present a feature driven opinion summarization method, where the term --driven-- is employed to describe the concept-to-detail (product class to product-specific characteristics) approach we took. For each product class we first automatically extract general features (characteristics describing any product, such as price, size, design), for each product we then extract specific features (as picture resolution in the case of a digital camera) and feature attributes (adjectives grading the characteristics, as for example high or low for price, small or big for size and modern or faddy for design). Further on, we assign a polarity (positive or negative) to each of the feature attributes using a previously annotated corpus and Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization[1] machine learning with the Normalized Google Distance[2]. We show how the method presented is employed to build a feature-driven opinion summarization system that is presently working in English and Spanish. In order to detect the product category, we use a modified system for person names classification. The raw review text is split into sentences and depending on the product class detected, only the phrases containing the specific product features are selected for further processing. The phrases extracted undergo a process of anaphora resolution, Named Entity Recognition and syntactic parsing. Applying syntactic dependency and part of speech patterns, we extract pairs containing the feature and the polarity of the feature attribute the customer associates to the feature in the review. Eventually, we statistically summarize the polarity of the opinions different customers expressed about the product on the web as percentages of positive and negative opinions about each of the product features. We show the results and improvements over baseline, together with a discussion on the strong and weak points of the method and the directions for future work.

1013;A FEATURE SELECTION METHOD BASED ON FISHERS DISCRIMINANT RATIO FOR TEXT SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Wang, S.a  c  and Li, D.b  c  and Wei, Y.d  and Li, H.a;2009;With the rapid growth of e-commerce, product reviews on the Web have become an important information source for customers decision making when they intend to buy some product. As the reviews are often too many for customers to go through, how to automatically classify them into different sentiment orientation categories (i.e. positive/negative) has become a research problem. In this paper, based on Fishers discriminant ratio, an effective feature selection method is proposed for product review text sentiment classification. In order to validate the validity of the proposed method, we compared it with other methods respectively based on information gain and mutual information while support vector machine is adopted as the classifier. In this paper, 6 subexperiments are conducted by combining different feature selection methods with 2 kinds of candidate feature sets. Under 1006 review documents of cars, the experimental results indicate that the Fishers discriminant ratio based on word frequency estimation has the best performance with F value 83.3% while the candidate features are the words which appear in both positive and negative texts.

The framework consists of three phases. The first phase is the preprocessing and cleaning of data collected, then data annotation. The second phase is applying various text processing techniques including: removing stopwords, replacing the negation words and the following negated words with the antonyms of the negated words, and using selective words of part-of-speech tags (adjectives and verbs) on the prepared corpora. The third phase is text classification using NaÃ¯ve Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigrams and bigrams. The experiments show that the data is extremely unbalanced. The results show that applying text processing techniques improve the classification accuracy of the NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier and reduce the training time of both classifiers.

1017;A FUZZY CONCEPTUALIZATION MODEL FOR TEXT MINING WITH APPLICATION IN OPINION POLARITY CLASSIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Li, S.-T.a  b  and Tsai, F.-C.a;2013;Automatic text classification in text mining is a critical technique to manage huge collections of documents. However, most existing document classification algorithms are easily affected by ambiguous terms. The ability to disambiguate for a classifier is thus as important as the ability to classify accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel classification framework based on fuzzy formal concept analysis to conceptualize documents into a more abstract form of concepts, and use these as the training examples to alleviate the arbitrary outcomes caused by ambiguous terms. The proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark testbed and two opinion polarity datasets. The experimental results indicate superior performance in all datasets. Applying concept analysis to opinion polarity classification is a leading endeavor in the disambiguation of Web 2.0 contents, and the approach presented in this paper offers significant improvements on current methods. The results of the proposed model reveal its ability to decrease the sensitivity to noise, as well as its adaptability in cross domain applications. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

1019;A GENERATE-AND-TEST METHOD OF DETECTING NEGATIVE-SENTIMENT SENTENCES;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Choi, Y.a  and Oh, H.-J.b  and Myaeng, S.-H.a;2012;Sentiment analysis requires human efforts to construct clue lexicons and/or annotations for machine learning, which are considered domain-dependent. This paper presents a sentiment analysis method where clues are learned automatically with a minimum training data at a sentence level. The main strategy is to learn and weight sentiment-revealing clues by first generating a maximal set of candidates from the annotated sentences for maximum recall and learning a classifier using linguistically-motivated composite features at a later stage for higher precision. The proposed method is geared toward detecting negative sentiment sentences as they are not appropriate for suggesting contextual ads. We show how clue-based sentiment analysis can be done without having to assume availability of a separately constructed clue lexicon. Our experimental work with both Korean and English news corpora shows that the proposed method outperforms word-feature based SVM classifiers. The result is especially encouraging because this relatively simple method can be used for documents in new domains and time periods for which sentiment clues may vary.

An approach for extracting features and polar words from textual opinion is based on syntactic pattern analysis. The evaluation is performed with existing opinions and compared the statistical resulted scores with the existing scores of each hotel.

1023;A LIGHTWEIGHT ALGORITHM FOR AUTOMATED FORUM INFORMATION PROCESSING;IEEE_B;IEEE;Wee Yong Lim and Sachan, A. and Thing, V.L.L.;2013;The vast variety of information on Web forums makes them a valuable resource for various purposes such as scam detection, national security protection and sentiment analysis. However, it is challenging to extract useful information from Web forums accurately and efficiently. First, several page types exist in Web forums and content is presented in different formats in these pages. Second, the content on the forum pages is stored in the form of data blocks. For the information to be meaningful, it is necessary to extract the relevant data blocks separately. The main problem with generic content extraction systems is that they cannot distinguish among various pages nor extract information with the required granularity. Although, several content extraction methods exist for Web forums, these methods either do not satisfy the above requirements or use heuristics based approaches (such as assumptions on standard visual appearances, etc., resulting in limited applicability to different varieties of forum). In this paper, we propose a general and efficient content extraction method using the properties of links present in forum pages. The effectiveness of our proposed method is shown through our experimental results.;Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT), 2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on;NULO;NULO;1;121-126;10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.18;NULO;Excluir
1024;A LOGIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH TO ASPECT EXTRACTION IN OPINION MINING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Liu, Q.a  b  and Gao, Z.a  b  and Liu, B.c  and Zhang, Y.d;2013;Aspect extraction aims to extract fine-grained opinion targets from opinion texts. Recent work has shown that the syntactical approach performs well. In this paper, we show that Logic Programming, particularly Answer Set Programming (ASP), can be used to elegantly and efficiently implement the key components of syntax based aspect extraction. Specifically, the well known double propagation (DP) method is implemented using 8 ASP rules that naturally model all key ideas in the DP method. Our experiment on a widely used data set also shows that the ASP implementation is much faster than a Java-based implementation. Syntactical approach has its limitation too. To further improve the performance of syntactical approach, we identify a set of general words from WordNet that have little chance to be an aspect and prune them when extracting aspects. The concept of general words and their pruning are concisely captured by 10 new ASP rules, and a natural extension of the 8 rules for the original DP method. Experimental results show a major improvement in precision with almost no drop in recall compared with those reported in the existing work on a typical benchmark data set. Logic Programming provides a convenient and effective tool to encode and thus test knowledge needed to improve the aspect extraction methods so that the researchers can focus on the identification and discovery of new knowledge to improve aspect extraction.

1025;A METHOD FOR OPINION MINING OF PRODUCT REVIEWS USING ASSOCIATION RULES;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Kim, W.Y.a  and Kim, K.I.b  and Ryu, J.S.a  and Kim, U.M.c;2009;When most people buy the products, they inquire about other peoples opinion and refer to recommended product. Today, the result of explosive development of the Web makes it easy to consult other peoples opinion information. These variety of opinion data are not only useful to customers, but also manufacturers. As a result, opinion mining research to analyze opinion data on the web has become a popular topic recently. In this paper, we proposed opinion mining method for product reviews. In our approach, we first do POS tagging on each review sentence, and we extract feature and opinion words in form of transaction data. Then we discover association rules of needed type from the transaction data, and provide information that is summarized advantages and disadvantages using PMI-IR algorithm.

1026;A METHOD OF FEATURE SELECTION AND SENTIMENT SIMILARITY FOR CHINESE MICRO-BLOGS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Yang, D.-H. and Yu, G.;2013;Sentiment analysis of messages posted on micro-blogs is helpful in determining the current usefulness and acceptability of target products or services. It is the basis for finding users with similar attitudes. In this paper, we propose a new sentiment similarity technique to analyse Chinese micro-blog accounts. However, the Chinese text features have not been well studied. Therefore, we first chose four types of feature sets and selected principle features by combining information gain and support vector machine techniques. Next, we compared the four types of features to determine which type of feature contributed more than others. Here we used three classification techniques: decision tree, support vector machines and naive Bayes. Finally, we used Karhunen-LoÃ©ve transform technique and average precision between positive and negative features to measure sentiment similarity. Experiment evaluations demonstrated that this new method is efficient and performs better than original average distance for Chinese micro-blogs.

1027;A MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION BASED APPROACH FOR SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Liu, S.M. and Chen, J.-H.;2015;A multi-label classification based approach for sentiment analysis is proposed in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose to use multi-label classification for sentiment classification of microblogs. The proposed prototype has three main components, text segmentation, feature extraction, and multi-label classification. Raw segmented words and sentiment features based on the three different sentiment dictionaries, Dalian University of Technology Sentiment Dictionary, National Taiwan University Sentiment Dictionary and HowNet Dictionary, are the features and the bag of words is the feature representation. A detailed empirical study of different multi-label classification methods on sentiment classification is conducted to compare their classification performances. Specifically, total 11 state of the art multi-label classification methods are compared on two microblog datasets and 8 evaluation metrics are used. The effects of the three sentiment dictionaries for multi-label classification are empirically studied and compared, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been performed. The performed empirical comparisons show that Dalian University of Technology Sentiment Dictionary has the best performance among the three different sentiment dictionaries.;Expert Systems with Applications;Article;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84908047013&partnerID=40&md5=eecb82974a08459179b6f8ef04a28ca8;42;1083-1093;10.1016/j.eswa.2014.08.036;NULO;Incluir

1029;A NEW METHOD OF USING CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION TO INFER THE SEMANTIC ORIENTATIONS OF CONTEXT DEPENDENT OPINIONS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Chunxu Wu and Lingfeng Shen and Xuan Wang;2009;Many researches focus on semantic analysis in opinion mining and get effective results. However, dealing with context dependent opinions is still a challenge. Existing methods have used linguistic rules to cope with this problem, however, when the opinion is irrelevant to its adjacent sentences, the linguistic rules will not work. These special opinions, in this paper, called context indistinct-dependent opinion. We propose a method to predict the orientation of these special opinions. The main idea of our approach is when the review an opinion lies in cannot provide enough contextual information to determine the orientation of opinion, we resort to other reviews discussing the same topic to mine useful contextual information, then use semantic similarity measures to judge the orientation of opinion. Our approach is innovative and experiment shows that the proposed technique is highly effective.;Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence, 2009. AICI 09.

1030;A NOVEL CONTEXT-BASED IMPLICIT FEATURE EXTRACTING METHOD;IEEE_B;IEEE;Sun, Li and Li, Sheng and Li, JiYun and Lv, JuTao;2014;One of the major steps for opinion mining is to extract product features. The vast majority of existing approaches focus on explicit feature identification, few attempts have been made to identify implicit features in reviews, however:, people tend to express their opinions with simple structures and brachylogies, which lead to more implicit features in reviews. By analyzing the characteristics of product reviews in Chinese on the Internet, this paper proposes a novel context-based implicit feature extracting method. We extract the implicit features according to the opinion words and the similarity between the product features in the implicit features context. We also build a matrix to show the relationship between opinion words and product features, then use a new algorithm to filter the noises in the matrix. Experiments show that our method provides higher accuracy in extracting the implicit features.;Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), 2014 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;420-424;10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058106;NULO;Incluir
1031;A NOVEL DETERMINISTIC APPROACH FOR ASPECT-BASED OPINION MINING IN TOURISM PRODUCTS REVIEWS;SCIENCE_DIRECT;SCIENCE_DIRECT;Edison Marrese-Taylor and Juan D. VelÃ¡squez and Felipe Bravo-Marquez;2014;Abstract This work proposes an extension of Bing Liuâ€™s aspect-based opinion mining approach in order to apply it to the tourism domain. The extension concerns with the fact that users refer differently to different kinds of products when writing reviews on the Web. Since Liuâ€™s approach is focused on physical product reviews, it could not be directly applied to the tourism domain, which presents features that are not considered by the model. Through a detailed study of on-line tourism product reviews, we found these features and then model them in our extension, proposing the use of new and more complex NLP-based rules for the tasks of subjective and sentiment classification at the aspect-level. We also entail the task of opinion visualization and summarization and propose new methods to help users digest the vast availability of opinions in an easy manner. Our work also included the development of a generic architecture for an aspect-based opinion mining tool, which we then used to create a prototype and analyze opinions from TripAdvisor in the context of the tourism industry in Los Lagos, a Chilean administrative region also known as the Lake District. Results prove that our extension is able to perform better than Liuâ€™s model in the tourism domain, improving both Accuracy and Recall for the tasks of subjective and sentiment classification. Particularly, the approach is very effective in determining the sentiment orientation of opinions, achieving an F-measure of 92% for the task. However, on average, the algorithms were only capable of extracting 35% of the explicit aspect expressions, using a non-extended approach for this task. Finally, results also showed the effectiveness of our design when applied to solving the industryâ€™s specific issues in the Lake District, since almost 80% of the users that used our tool considered that our tool adds valuable information to their business.;Expert Systems with Applications;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417414003315;41;7764 - 7775;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.05.045;0957-4174;Incluir
1032;A NOVEL FEATURE-BASED METHOD FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF CHINESE PRODUCT REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Liu Lizhen and Song Wei and Wang Hanshi and Li Chuchu and Jingli, L.;2014;Sentiment analysis of online reviews and other user generated content is an important research problem for its wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-based vector model and a novel weighting algorithm for sentiment analysis of Chinese product reviews. Specifically, an opinionated document is modeled by a set of feature-based vectors and corresponding weights. Different from previous work, our model considers modifying relationships between words and contains rich sentiment strength descriptions which are represented by adverbs of degree and punctuations. Dependency parsing is applied to construct the feature vectors. A novel feature weighting algorithm is proposed for supervised sentiment classifcation based on rich sentiment strength related information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with a state of the art method using term level weighting algorithms.;Communications, China;NULO;NULO;11;154-164;10.1109/CC.2014.6825268;1673-5447;Excluir

We compare the performance of our model with that of the classical representation based on Vector Space Model (VSM). Our experiments show that the effectiveness of our model depends on the used classifier. Results yielded by kNN when applying our model are the same as those obtained when applying the classical VSM. For SVM, results yielded when applying our model are typically lower than those obtained when using VSM. However, the gain in terms of time and dimensionality reduction is so promising since they are dramatically decreased by the application of our model.;Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), 2013 ACS International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1-2;10.1109/AICCSA.2013.6616499;2161-5322;Excluir

An unsupervised twice-clustering based product features categorization method is proposed. Opinion words in context of product features are chosen to represent the interrelationship among product features instead of full context information. The cluster result of active product features is used as constraints to improve the whole categorization quality. Our experimental results show that opinion words in context and their group information are very important features in measuring the semantic similarity of their associated product features. The twice-clustering strategy achieves better performance than single-clustering method.;Web Information Systems and Mining (WISM), 2010 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;1;281-284;10.1109/WISM.2010.71;NULO;Incluir

1038;A SEMANTIC APPROACH TO THE EXTRACTION OF FEATURE TERMS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Angioni, M. and Tuveri, F.;2011;Understanding the meaning of a text depends on the knowledge the reader has about the topic addressed in a document, starting from the most complex concept to the simplest one. The representation of the knowledge is generally performed by ontologies, semantic networks, or typified by statistical algorithms able to organize the contents according to rules based on frequency of terms or synsets. The Opinion Mining is a way to go beyond text categorization through the analysis of the opinions related to a specific topic: a product, a service, a tourist location, etc. In this paper we propose to apply our experience in the semantic analysis of textual resources to the Opinion Mining task, with the aim to propose a different approach to the extraction of feature terms, performing a contextualisation by means of semantic categorisation, a semantic net of concept and by a set of qualities associated to the sense expressed by adjectives and adverbs.;ICSOFT 2011 - Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Software and Database Technologies;Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-80052566118&partnerID=40&md5=8cf84ca4023015e945318b27218899fe;2;402-407;NULO;NULO;Incluir

1042;A STATISTICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH TO SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Carvalho, J. and Prado, A. and Plastino, A.;2014;In the past years, the Web has become a huge source of opinionative data. Social media, such as Twitter, are regarded as public diaries, where millions of people express their sentiments and opinions in their daily interaction. One of the biggest challenges in the analysis of such data, is the classification of their polarity, that is, whether they carry a positive or negative connotation. For this purpose, statistical methods have been inspired by the observation that if two words frequently appear together within the same context, they are likely to have the same polarity. Consequently, the polarity of a word can be determined by calculating its relative frequency of co-occurrence with special words, called paradigm words, whose polarities are invariantly preserved (e.g., --good-- and --bad--). In this way, one can classify, for example, a tweet as carrying a positive polarity, if the majority of its words is more strongly associated with the word --good-- than with the word --bad--. In current statistical approaches, such paradigm words have been selected following different criteria, without any prior evaluation. Motivated by this observation, we propose to classify tweets via a statistical method where the paradigm words are selected by means of a genetic algorithm. This algorithm explores a set of paradigm words to find a subset of such words that leads to a significant improvement of the classification accuracy. Additionally, we believe that an appropriate set of paradigm words may vary according to the data domain. For example, paradigm words applied in the classification of tweets in the domain of movies may not be convenient to classify tweets related to products. We prove this assumption empirically, using tweets from different domains, and show that our approach deals properly with this problem.;Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT), 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on;NULO;NULO;2;110-117;10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.87;NULO;Excluir

1046;A SYNTACTIC APPROACH FOR ASPECT BASED OPINION MINING;IEEE_A;IEEE;Chinsha, T.C. and Joseph, S.;2015;Opinion mining or sentiment analysis is the process of analysing the text about a topic written in a natural language and classify them as positive negative or neutral based on the humans sentiments, emotions, opinions expressed in it. Nowadays, the opinions expressed through reviews are increasing day by day on the web. It is practically impossible to analyse and extract opinions from such huge number of reviews manually. To solve this problem an automated opinion mining approach is needed. This task of automatic opinion mining can be done mainly at three different levels, which are document level, sentence level and aspect level. Most of the previous work is in the field of document or sentence level opinion mining. This paper focus on aspect level opinion mining and propose a new syntactic based approach for it, which uses syntactic dependency, aggregate score of opinion words, SentiWordNet and aspect table together for opinion mining. The experimental work was done on restaurant reviews. The dataset of restaurant reviews was collected from web and tagged manually. The proposed method achieved total accuracy of 78.04% on the annotated test set. The method was also compared with the method, which uses Part-Of-Speech tagger for feature extraction:, the obtained results show that the proposed method gives 6% more accuracy than previous one on the annotated test set.;Semantic Computing (ICSC), 2015 IEEE International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;24-31;10.1109/ICOSC.2015.7050774;NULO;Incluir

1048;ACOUSTICS, CONTENT AND GEO-INFORMATION BASED SENTIMENT PREDICTION FROM LARGE-SCALE NETWORKED VOICE DATA;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zhu Ren and Jia Jia and Quan Guo and Kuo Zhang and Lianhong Cai;2014;Sentiment analysis from large-scale networked data attracts increasing attention in recent years. Most previous works on sentiment prediction mainly focus on text or image data. However, voice is the most natural and direct way to express peoples sentiments in real-time. With the rapid development of smart phone voice dialogue applications (e.g., Siri and Sogou Voice Assistant), the large-scale networked voice data can help us better quantitatively understand the sentimental world we live in. In this paper, we study the problem of sentiment prediction from large-scale networked voice data.

1049;ACTIVE LEARNING ENHANCED SEMI-AUTOMATIC ANNOTATION TOOL FOR ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Smatana, M. and Koncz, P. and Smatana, P. and ParaliÄ�, J.;2013;Aspect-based sentiment analysis has become popular research field which allows the quantification of textual evaluations of different aspects of products and services. Methods of aspect-based sentiment analysis built on machine learning usually depend on manually annotated training corpora. In order to facilitate the processes of their creation, annotation tools dedicated to this purpose are needed. In this work we proposed a semi-automatic annotation tool which uses active learning to increase the effectiveness of the documents annotation. The use of active learning adapted to the needs of aspect-based sentiment analysis is the main difference between the proposed solution and existing annotation tools. We applied it in the domain of hotels evaluations. The results of realized experiments confirmed the faster increase of the annotation suggestions quality in terms of F1-measure in comparison to the scenario without active learning.

We study the effect of subjectivity-based features on sentiment classification on two lexicons and also propose new subjectivity-based features for sentiment classification. The subjectivity-based features we experiment with are based on the average word polarity and the new features that we propose are based on the occurrence of subjective words in review texts.

1051;AFFECTIVE AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF ONLINE DEPRESSION COMMUNITIES;IEEE_B;IEEE;Thin Nguyen and Dinh Phung and Bo Dao and Venkatesh, S. and Berk, M.;2014;A large number of people use online communities to discuss mental health issues, thus offering opportunities for new understanding of these communities. This paper aims to study the characteristics of online depression communities (CLINICAL) in comparison with those joining other online communities (CONTROL). We use machine learning and statistical methods to discriminate online messages between depression and control communities using mood, psycholinguistic processes and content topics extracted from the posts generated by members of these communities. All aspects including mood, the written content and writing style are found to be significantly different between two types of communities. Sentiment analysis shows the clinical group have lower valence than people in the control group. For language styles and topics, statistical tests reject the hypothesis of equality on psycholinguistic processes and topics between two groups. We show good predictive validity in depression classification using topics and psycholinguistic clues as features. Clear discrimination between writing styles and contents, with good predictive power is an important step in understanding social media and its use in mental health.;Affective Computing, IEEE Transactions on;NULO;NULO;5;217-226;10.1109/TAFFC.2014.2315623;1949-3045;Excluir

1053;AN APPROACH BASED ON TREE KERNELS FOR OPINION MINING OF ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Peng Jiang and Chunxia Zhang and Hongping Fu and Zhendong Niu and Qing Yang;2010;Opinion mining is a challenging task to identify the opinions or sentiments underlying user generated contents, such as online product reviews, blogs, discussion forums, etc. Previous studies that adopt machine learning algorithms mainly focus on designing effective features for this complex task. This paper presents our approach based on tree kernels for opinion mining of online product reviews. Tree kernels alleviate the complexity of feature selection and generate effective features to satisfy the special requirements in opinion mining. In this paper, we define several tree kernels for sentiment expression extraction and sentiment classification, which are subtasks of opinion mining. Our proposed tree kernels encode not only syntactic structure information, but also sentiment related information, such as sentiment boundary and sentiment polarity, which are important features to opinion mining. Experimental results on a benchmark data set indicate that tree kernels can significantly improve the performance of both sentiment expression extraction and sentiment classification. Besides, a linear combination of our proposed tree kernels and traditional feature vector kernel achieves the best performances using the benchmark data set.;Data Mining (ICDM), 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;256-265;10.1109/ICDM.2010.104;1550-4786;Excluir

Many algorithms have been applied to solve this problem. Most of them fail to handle the large scale web data. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for BN(Bayesian Networks) structure leaning from large-scale dateset by using a MapReduce cluster. Then, we apply this parallel BN learning algorithm to capture the dependencies among words, and, at the same time, finds a vocabulary that is efficient for the purpose of extracting sentiments. The benefits of using MapReduce for BN structure learning are discussed. The performance of using BN to extract sentiments is demonstrated by applying it to real web blog data. Experimental results on the web data set show that our algorithm is able to select a parsimonious feature set with substantially fewer predictor variables than in the full data set and leads to better predictions about sentiment orientations than several usually used methods.

1062;AN ENHANCED FEATURE-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Venumbaka, S.a  c  and Li, L.a  c  and Tian, F.b  d;2014;Due to the increased usage of Internet sources such as websites and forums, sentiment analysis has become a challenging research area in the past decade. There are many feature-based sentiment analysis approaches where features can be the word itself, or its part-of-speech, or some polarity tags. However, the used lexical resources (positive and negative word lists) do not generate accurate opinion extraction results. Another problem in the existing approaches is that the words are processed separately and cannot efficiently solve complex opinion structures (e.g., I do not think it is a bad product). The enhanced feature-based sentiment analysis system in this paper overcomes these limitations and improves the accuracy of opinion extraction. At first, an open source tool called Stanford Parser is employed to stem each word and add the parts-of-speech (POS) tag. Then the lists of positive words, negative words, and other words that can invert, increase or decrease the opinion are built using SentiWordNet. Next, a set of rules is proposed to enrich tags to the words that can invert, increase, or decrease the opinion. The final opinion is determined by aggregating the opinion weights at word-level, sentence-level and document-level. The experimental results show that the new sentiment analysis system achieves the high accuracy of 84%.

Most of these algorithms are based on bag-of-words representations, which generate high dimensional data. However, just a few supervised learning methods, such as SVMs, can efficiently handle high dimensional data. To overcome this limitation we propose the use of prior polarity words (PPW) in order to create a compact and representative feature set for financial news classification. Using this approach it is possible to reduce feature sets from thousands to less than tens of features without compromising the accuracy of the text classifier. We measured accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and ROC AUC of text classifiers using PPW. Classifier using PPW was able to topping all results when compared with a wide range of feature selection methods. By adopting PPW, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes performed consistently better than using the full feature set. PPW also turned Naive Bayes comparable to SVMs, as indicated by the improved performance scores in all measures tested.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Article;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84921418746&partnerID=40&md5=e2b63c5a0bd1a62bc9ad1bdb4545ee61;8864;218-228;10.1007/978-3-319-12027-0_18;NULO;Excluir
1064;AN INFORMATION THEORETIC APPROACH TO TEXT SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Coutinho, D.P.a  c  and Figueiredo, M.A.T.b  c c;2013;Most approaches to text sentiment analysis rely on human generated lexicon-based feature selection methods, supervised vector-based learning methods, and other solutions that seek to capture sentiment information. Most of these methods, in order to yield acceptable accuracy, require a complex preprocessing stage and careful feature engineering. This paper introduces a coding-theoretic-based sentiment analysis method that dispenses with any text preprocessing or explicit feature engineering, but still achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. By applying the Ziv-Merhav method to estimate the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) and the cross parsing length from pairs of sequences of text symbols, we get information theoretic measures that make very few assumptions about the models which are assumed to have generated the sequences. Using these measures, we follow a dissimilarity space approach, on which we apply a standard support vector machine classifier. Experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on a text sentiment analysis problem (more specifically, movie reviews sentiment polarity classification) reveals that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, despite being much simpler than the competing methods.;ICPRAM 2013 - Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods;Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84877987821&partnerID=40&md5=4eb05d5ee536ecf2af40baf44c317f1b;NULO;577-580;NULO;NULO;Excluir

Enterprises have already realized the usefulness of social networks to enable marketing campaigns and communicate with their customers. However, only few enterprises use social network as an active source of information, interacting with the networks users in (near-)real time, e.g. for crowdsourcing and leveraging open-innovation. To encourage and facilitate this use of networks, we believe it is needed an information discovery system which elaborates simultaneously over more-than-one networks in an integrated scenario. Such a system has to be able to handle the speed at which the contents of social network are generated, the huge amount of available data and dynamism at which networks evolve and new kind of content are shared.

1066;AN ONTOLOGY BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR MOBILE PRODUCTS USING TWEETS;IEEE_A;IEEE;Nithish, R. and Sabarish, S. and Kishen, M.N. and Abirami, A.M. and Askarunisa, A.;2013;Large amount of data is ubiquitous in the internet giving the challenges to identify the relevant information from the documents. Marketing or sales people do analysis on their products reach using surveys, feedback and queries etc. using online forms. All these unstructured text and voluminous data have to be analyzed manually or semi-automatically to understand the context and make decisions on the business. Similarly to buy any products online, people usually search and get opinion on the products from friends before taking their decisions. Whenever a new product is launched in the market, the social networking sites are deluged with reviews and comments about the product. We can exploit this to the advantage of determining the reach of the product among the common mass by applying sentiment analysis over these reviews. The use of this is twofold- (i) The seller gets first-hand information about the products reach (ii) Buyer can buy the right product for his need. In this paper, we propose a model to store the product information as ontologies, thereby bringing strong relationships among the data stored. We add more semantics by embedding the opinions, determined using sentiment analysis, within the linked data thereby accounting for better reasoning and efficient querying. We propose a method to perform opinion mining on products by extracting the comments on products features from the reviews posted in a micro-blogging site such as twitter. The sentiment analysis is done on these reviews to rate the product features. These opinions are stored along with the product-feature descriptions in the domain ontology in OWL format. Once the opinions are embedded in the ontology, the model can serve for better reasoning and answering intelligent queries. This information can also be recommended to the people who are in need when they search for similar products which help them to make necessary decisions based on the others opinions.;Advanced Computing (ICoAC), 2013 Fifth International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;342-347;10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6921974;NULO;Incluir
1067;AN OPINION FEATURE EXTRACTION APPROACH BASED ON A MULTIDIMENSIONAL SENTENCE ANALYSIS MODEL;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Guo, J.-L.a  b  and Peng, J.-E.a  and Wang, H.-C.a;2013;With Web 2.0 applications being widely used, social networking services, including web blogs, forums, and other online communities, have become informative tools that help individuals to easily gauge the pulse of the electronic consuming market. As a substitute for traditional public media, the related site provides unique mechanisms to instantly reveal the degree of public product acceptance by either statistically aggregating the rating results or archiving opinions shared by experienced customers. However, the growth of user-generated information and its scattered unstructured contents is overwhelming to users, thereby triggering the demand for a more efficient system that can offer concise information. Most existing efforts dedicated to these issues may neglect vital aspects of the sentence-level context. This article aims to explore the critical features hidden in the sentential structure of opinion articles and expects that the detected patterns may contribute to the enhancement of related applications. Accordingly, a multidimensional sentence modeling algorithm (MSMA) is designed to evaluate various sentential characteristics and adopt a genetic algorithm to optimize the weighting scheme while determining feature importance. The study also makes use of the public knowledge resource Wikipedia as a global reference to fine-tune the feature sets effectiveness and enhance the overall performance of this framework. The results of experiments on an electronic product data set demonstrate that the proposed method is promising and provides significant improvement over previous studies.

We take nouns and adjectives into consideration, and make full use of their relevance. The other part mines the relationship between clusters and terms based on LDA result, using a modified PageRank method. The two algorithms are combined to rescore these candidate targets.

1072;AN UNSUPERVISED OPINION MINING APPROACH FOR JAPANESE WEBLOG REPUTATION INFORMATION USING AN IMPROVED SO-PMI ALGORITHM;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Wang, G. and Araki, K.;2008;In this paper, we propose an improved SO-PMI (Semantic Orientation Using Pointwise Mutual Information) algorithm, for use in Japanese Weblog Opinion Mining. SO-PMI is an unsupervised approach proposed by Turney that has been shown to work well for English. When this algorithm was translated into Japanese naively, most phrases, whether positive or negative in meaning, received a negative SO. For dealing with this slanting phenomenon, we propose three improvements: to expand the reference words to sets of words, to introduce a balancing factor and to detect neutral expressions. In our experiments, the proposed improvements obtained a well-balanced result: both positive and negative accuracy exceeded 62%, when evaluated on 1,200 opinion sentences sampled from three different domains (reviews of Electronic Products, Cars and Travels from Kakaku.com). In a comparative experiment on the same corpus, a supervised approach (SA-Demo) achieved a very similar accuracy to our method.

1073;AN UNSUPERVISED SENTIMENT INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION APPROACH;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;Xu, Panpan and Jin, Huilan and Shi, Hanxiao and Chen, Wei;2013;Existing research focuses on document-based sentiment analysis and documents are represented by the bag-of-words model. However, due to the loss of contextual information, this representation fails to capture the associative information between an opinion and its corresponding target. Additionally, several researchers focus on sentence-based approaches, which can effectively extract an aspect-sentiment word pair within one sentence. Nevertheless, their approaches can only deal with one aspect within one sentence and miss the identification of sentiment modifier. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel identification approach of aspect-modifier-sentiment word triple using shallow semantic information. Experimental results show that our approach is feasible and effective.;Information Technology Applications in Industry, Pts 1-4;Book Section;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000318818701302;263-266;3330-3334;10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.263-266.3330;1660-9336978-3-03785-574-4;Incluir
1074;AN UPGRADING FEATURE-BASED OPINION MINING MODEL ON VIETNAMESE PRODUCT REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Ha, Q.-T. and Vu, T.-T. and Pham, H.-T. and Luu, C.-T.;2011;Feature-based opinion mining and summarizing (FOMS) of reviews is an interesting issue in the opinion mining field. SentiWordNet is an useful lexical resource for opinion mining, especially for FOMS. In this paper, an upgrading FOMS model on Vietnamese reviews on mobile phone products is described. Feature words and opinion words were extracted based on some Vietnamese syntactic rules. Extracted feature words were grouped by using HAC clustering and semi-supervised SVM-kNN classification. Customers opinion orientation and summarization on features was determined by using a VietSentiWordNet, which had been extended from an initial VietSentiWordNet. Experiments on feature extraction and opinion summarization on features are showed.

1076;ANALYZING POLITICAL SENTIMENT ON TWITTER;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Ringsquandl, M. and PetkoviÄ‡, D.;2013;Due to the vast amount of user-generated content in the emerging Web 2.0, there is a growing need for computational processing of sentiment analysis in documents. Most of the current research in this field is devoted to product reviews from websites. Microblogs and social networks pose even a greater challenge to sentiment classification. However, especially marketing and political campaigns leverage from opinions expressed on Twitter or other social communication platforms. The objects of interest in this paper are the presidential candidates of the Republican Party in the USA and their campaign topics. In this paper we introduce the combination of the noun phrases frequency and their PMI measure as constraint on aspect extraction. This compensates for sparse phrases receiving a higher score than those composed of high-frequency words. Evaluation shows that the meronymy relationship between politicians and their topics holds and improves accuracy of aspect extraction.

A scheme based on Vector Space Model (VSM) is put forward for identifying the sentiment orientation of document. Considering the feature of a document is relative to the term frequencies appears in the document and corpus, we extract the feature of document by using the popular formula TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and the weight of term is computed based on a sentiment lexicon, which is built manually. In the sentiment lexicon, we divide Chinese words into three types according to the sentiment orientation of word and each word is assigned a weight according to the polarity of words.

1080;ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY OPTIMIZATION FOR FEATURE SELECTION IN OPINION MINING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Sumathi, T.a  and Karthik, S.b  and Marikkannan, M.a;2014;Opinion mining, a sub-discipline of information retrieval and computational linguistics concerns not with what a document is about, but with its expressed opinion. Feature selection is an important step in opinion mining, as customers express product opinions separately according to individual features. Earlier research on feature-based opinion mining had many drawbacks like selecting a feature considering only grammatical information or treating features with same meanings as different. However this led to a large corpus which subsequently affected the classification accuracy. Statistical techniques like Correlation Based Feature (CFS) have been extensively used for feature selection to reduce the corpus size. The selected features are sub optimal due to the Non Polynomial (NP) hard nature of the technique used. In this work, we propose Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm for optimization of feature subset. NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm (FURIA) and Ripple Down Rule Learner (RIDOR) classifiers are used for classification. The proposed method is compared with features extracted based on Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). Hence, this method is useful for reducing feature subset size and computational complexity thereby increasing the classification accuracy. Â© 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

1082;ASPECT AND SENTIMENT EXTRACTION BASED ON INFORMATION-THEORETIC CO-CLUSTERING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Fu, X. and Guo, Y. and Guo, W. and Wang, Z.;2012;In this paper, we propose an aspect and sentiment extraction method based on information-theoretic Co-clustering. Unlike the existing feature based sentiment analysis methods, which only process the explicit associations between feature words and sentiment words. Our method considers the implicit associations intra evaluated features, the association intra sentiment words, and the associations inter evaluated features and sentiment words. At first, the co-occurrence relationships of feature words and sentiment words are represented as a feature-sentiment words matrix. And with the feature-sentiment words matrix, the information-theoretic Co-clustering algorithm is used to simultaneously cluster evaluated features and sentiment words. The clustering results of feature words are viewed as different aspects of the evaluated objects, and the clustering results of sentiment words which are associated with different aspects are viewed as aspect specific sentiment words. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can obtain good performance of aspect and sentiment extraction.

1083;ASPECT BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIER;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Varghese, R. and Jayasree, M.;2013;Sentiment Analysis involves the process of identifying the polarity of opinionated texts. Lots of social networking sites are being used for expressing thoughts and opinions by users to rate products. These user opinionated text is highly unstructured in nature and thus involves the application of various natural language processing techniques. In aspect based sentiment analysis, the various features of a product is identified through the training process. For e.g. the aspects of a camera are picture quality, size, resolution etc. The quantitative analysis of each aspect is done using support vector machine classifier. In most of the previous works, a product review is analysed as a whole rather than considering each aspect of it. Aspect based opinion mining is tedious since the identification of individual features is in itself a challenging task.

1084;ASPECT BASED SUMMARIZATION OF CONTEXT DEPENDENT OPINION WORDS;SCIENCE_DIRECT;SCIENCE_DIRECT;Hitesh Kansal and Durga Toshniwal;2014;Abstract Popularity and availability of opinion-rich resources in e-commerce platform is growing rapidly. Before buying any product, one is interested to know the opinion of other people about that product. For any product, there are hundreds of reviews available online so it becomes very difficult for the customers to read all the reviews. Also, one cannot set his mind based on reading some of the review since it gives him a biased view about that product. So we need to automate this process. As we know, there are lots of opinion words present in the sentences of a review which will tell about the polarity of that product. Out of all the opinion words, some words behave in the same manner means they have the same polarity in all contexts, but some words are context dependent means they have different polarity in different context. In this paper, we proposed an Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis and Summarization (ASAS) System, which handles the context dependent opinion words that has been the cause of major difficulties. For finding the opinion polarity, first, we used an online dictionary for classifying the context independent opinion word. Second, we used natural linguistic rules for assigning the polarity to maximum possible context dependent words. These steps create the training data set. Third, for classification of the remaining opinion words, we used opinion words and feature together rather than opinion words alone, because the same opinion word can have different polarity in the same domain. Then we used our Interaction Information method to classify the feature-opinion pairs. Fourth, as negation plays a very crucial role, we found negation words and flipped the polarity of the corresponding opinion word. Finally, after classifying each opinion word, the system generated a short summary for that particular product based on each feature;Procedia Computer Science;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914010618;35;166 - 175;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2014.08.096;1877-0509;Incluir
1085;ASPECT EXTRACTION THROUGH SEMI-SUPERVISED MODELING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Mukherjee, A. and Liu, B.;2012;Aspect extraction is a central problem in sentiment analysis. Current methods either extract aspects without categorizing them, or extract and categorize them using unsupervised topic modeling. By categorizing, we mean the synonymous aspects should be clustered into the same category. In this paper, we solve the problem in a different setting where the user provides some seed words for a few aspect categories and the model extracts and clusters aspect terms into categories simultaneously. This setting is important because categorizing aspects is a subjective task. For different application purposes, different categorizations may be needed. Some form of user guidance is desired. In this paper, we propose two statistical models to solve this seeded problem, which aim to discover exactly what the user wants. Our experimental results show that the two proposed models are indeed able to perform the task effectively.

1089;ASPECT-BASED OPINION MINING FROM PRODUCT REVIEWS;ACM;ACM;Moghaddam, Samaneh and Ester, Martin;2012;--What other people think-- has always been an important piece of information for most of us during the decision-making process. Today people tend to make their opinions available to other people via the Internet. As a result, the Web has become an excellent source of consumer opinions. There are now numerous Web resources containing such opinions, e.g., product reviews forums, discussion groups, and blogs. But, it is really difficult for a customer to read all of the reviews and make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It is also difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and manage customer opinions. Also, focusing on just user ratings (stars) is not a sufficient source of information for a user or the manufacturer to make decisions. Therefore, mining online reviews (opinion mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction. Extracting aspects and the corresponding ratings is an important challenge in opinion mining. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, e.g. zoom for a digital camera. A rating is an intended interpretation of the user satisfaction in terms of numerical values. Reviewers usually express the rating of an aspect by a set of sentiments, e.g. great zoom. In this tutorial we cover opinion mining in online product reviews with the focus on aspect-based opinion mining. This problem is a key task in the area of opinion mining and has attracted a lot of researchers in the information retrieval community recently. Several opinion related information retrieval tasks can benefit from the results of aspect-based opinion mining and therefore it is considered as a fundamental problem. This tutorial covers not only general opinion mining and retrieval tasks, but also state-of-the-art methods, challenges, applications, and also future research directions of aspect-based opinion mining.;Proceedings of the 35th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;NULO;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2348283.2348533;NULO;1184--1184;10.1145/2348283.2348533;978-1-4503-1472-5;Incluir

As the recent trend in research extends the use of these devices to a broader range of applications, questioning the reliability and accuracy of these devices became much more legitimate. In this research, we assess the public opinion on these devices through utilizing novel sentiment analysis techniques to build a fully automated aspect-based sentiment summarizer that transfers the sheer amount of Amazon reviews of these products to a user-friendly summary. Product features are extracted using the text of reviews, the description and features sections on Amazon. Another approach is also proposed that extracts the names of competing products and compares their reviews to separate the features from the other common nouns. To enhance sentiment classication, the system combines two sentiment lexicons, handles complex negation types through parsing while handling semantic relations, and assigns the sentiment tothe proper product and feature. The proposed summarizerâ€™s components generally outperform the stateof- the-art methods with notable improvements in detecting product features, competing products and negation and can easily generalize to other domains.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84915737596&partnerID=40&md5=276377e6198f6d5fd323ff10b5796a33;8643;50-61;10.1007/978-3-319-13186-3_6;NULO;Incluir

In contrast to most studies that focus on determining only sentiment orientation (positive versus negative), the proposed method performs fine-grained analysis to determine both the sentiment orientation and sentiment strength of the reviewer towards various aspects of a movie. Sentences in review documents contain independent clauses that express different sentiments toward different aspects of a movie. The method adopts a linguistic approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause. The prior sentiment scores of about 32,000 individual words are derived from SentiWordNet with the help of a subjectivity lexicon. Negation is delicately handled. The output sentiment scores can be used to identify the most positive and negative clauses or sentences with respect to particular movie aspects.

1093;ASPECT-BASED TWITTER SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION;IEEE_A;IEEE;Hsiang Hui Lek and Poo, D.C.C.;2013;Due to the popularity of Twitter, sentiment classification for Twitter has become a hot research topic. Previous studies have approached the problem as a tweet-level classification task where each tweet is classified as positive, negative or neutral. However, getting an overall sentiment might not be useful to organizations which are using twitter for monitoring consumer opinion of their products/services. Instead, it is more useful to determine specifically which aspects of the products/services the users are happy or unhappy about. This paper proposes an aspect-based sentiment classification approach to analyze sentiments for tweets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to perform sentiment analysis for Twitter in this manner. We conducted several experiments and show that by incorporating results from the aspect-based sentiment classifier, we are able to improve existing tweet-level classifiers.

In this paper, we propose two novel probabilistic generative models (APSM and ME-APSM) to extract aspects and aspect-specific polarity-aware sentiments from online reviews. We applied our models to two data sets with three different experiments. Experimental results show that APSM and ME-APSM models can extract aspects and polarity-aware sentiments well.

1097;AUTOMATIC JUDGMENT OF THE SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY OF THE CHINESE WORDS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zhang Jing and Jin Hao;2010;The effective automatic judgment of the Chinese words sentiment polarity, the most important part of the Chinese sentiment analysis, can improve the building of the subjectivity lexicon and the efficiency of the sentiment analysis. The technology of the Chinese word subjectivity and objectivity judgment is discussed and analyzed, the subjectivity dictionary is defined and the subjective feature model is established by the use of the sentiment polarity of the word and the subjectivity intensity feature set. The machine learning method applied in the subjective feature set achieves the subjectivity classifier to automatically judge the word subjectivity and to compare and optimize. The performance is improved. The highest accuracy of KNN reaches 81.27%, and the F value is up to 81.52%. So it is effective to establish the word subjectivity feature set, using the sentiment polarity of and the subjectivity intensity feature the words. The automatic judgment of the word subjectivity through machine learning achieves excellent performance.;Intelligent Computing and Cognitive Informatics (ICICCI), 2010 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;160-163;10.1109/ICICCI.2010.58;NULO;Excluir
1098;AUTOMATIC OPINION EXTRACTION FROM WEB DOCUMENTS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Shandilya, S.K. and Jain, D.S.;2009;Automatic extraction of human opinions from Web documents has been receiving increasing interest. An important part of the information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinionrich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. In this paper, we demonstrate an opinion mining framework that extracts the opinions and views of the consumers/customers, and analyze them to provide concrete market flow along with proven statistical data. The software uses classification, clustering and lingual knowledge-based opinion mining for providing these features.

1099;AUTOMATIC SENTIMENT EXTRACTION FROM YOUTUBE VIDEOS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Kaushik, L. and Sangwan, A. and Hansen, J.H.L.;2013;Extracting speaker sentiment from natural audio streams such as YouTube is challenging. A number of factors contribute to the task difficulty, namely, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of spontaneous speech, unknown background environments, variable source and channel characteristics, accents, diverse topics, etc. In this study, we build upon our previous work [5], where we had proposed a system for detecting sentiment in YouTube videos. Particularly, we propose several enhancements including (i) better text-based sentiment model due to training on larger and more diverse dataset, (ii) an iterative scheme to reduce sentiment model complexity with minimal impact on performance accuracy, (iii) better speech recognition due to superior acoustic modeling and focused (domain dependent) vocabulary/language models, and (iv) a larger evaluation dataset. Collectively, our enhancements provide an absolute 10% improvement over our previous system in terms of sentiment detection accuracy. Additionally, we also present analysis that helps understand the impact of WER (word error rate) on sentiment detection accuracy. Finally, we investigate the relative importance of different Parts-of-Speech (POS) tag features towards sentiment detection. Our analysis reveals the practicality of this technology and also provides several potential directions for future work.;Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), 2013 IEEE Workshop on;NULO;NULO;NULO;239-244;10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707736;NULO;Excluir
1100;AUTOMATICALLY DETECTING AND RATING PRODUCT ASPECTS FROM TEXTUAL CUSTOMER REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Bancken, W. and Alfarone, D. and Davis, J.;2014;This paper proposes a new approach to aspect-based sentiment analysis. The goal of our algorithm is to obtain a summary of the most positive and the most negative aspects of a specific product, given a collection of free-text customer reviews. Our approach starts by matching handcrafted dependency paths in individual sentences to find opinions expressed towards candidate aspects. Then, it clusters together different mentions of the same aspect by using a WordNet-based similarity measure. Finally, it computes a sentiment score for each aspect, which represents the overall emerging opinion of a group of customers towards a specific aspect of the product. Our approach does not require any seed word or domain-specific knowledge, as it only employs an off-the-shelf sentiment lexicon. We discuss encouraging preliminary results in detecting and rating aspects from on-line reviews of movies and MP3 players.;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84920929643&partnerID=40&md5=ebcb95a9aa8bf85d916c3242ec8d8df4;1202;1-16;NULO;NULO;Incluir

1102;AUTOMATICALLY MINING REVIEW RECORDS FROM FORUM WEB SITES;IEEE_B;IEEE;Wei Liu and Hualiang Yan and Jianguo Xiao;2010;The rapid development of Web 2.0 bring the flourish of web reviews. Web reviews are usually released in form of structured records. As the important information source for many popular applications(e.g. monitoring and analysis of public opinion), review records need to be extracted accurately from web pages. To the best of our knowledge, little work in literatures has systemically investigated this problem. Besides the variety of web page templates, the user-generated review contents raises a new challenge. The inconsistency of review contents on both DOM tree and visual appearance impair the similarity among review records, which makes a serious impact on performance of the existing solutions on web data record extraction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach that performs automatic extraction of review records by employing sophisticated techniques. Our experimental results over 20 forum web sites indicate that the proposed approach can achieve high extraction accuracy.;Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD), 2010 Seventh International Conference on;NULO;NULO;5;2450-2455;10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569292;NULO;Excluir
1103;BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF AN UGLY PLACE. EXPLORING PHOTO COLLECTIONS USING OPINION AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF USER COMMENTS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Kisilevich, S. and Rohrdantz, C. and Keim, D.;2010;User generated content in the form of customer reviews, feedbacks and comments plays an important role in all types of Internet services and activities like news, shopping, forums and blogs. Therefore, the analysis of user opinions is potentially beneficial for the understanding of user attitudes or the improvement of various Internet services. In this paper, we propose a practical unsupervised approach to improve user experience when exploring photo collections by using opinions and sentiments expressed in user comments on the uploaded photos. While most existing techniques concentrate on binary (negative or positive) opinion orientation, we use a real-valued scale for modeling opinion and sentiment strengths. We extract two types of sentiments: opinions that relate to the photo quality and general sentiments targeted towards objects depicted on the photo. Our approach combines linguistic features for part of speech tagging, traditional statistical methods for modeling word importance in the photo comment corpora (in a real-valued scale), and a predefined sentiment lexicon for detecting negative and positive opinion orientation. In addition, a semi-automatic photo feature detection method is applied and a set of syntactic patterns is introduced to resolve opinion references. We implemented a prototype system that incorporates the proposed approach and evaluates it on several regions in the World using real data extracted from Flickr.;Computer Science and Information Technology (IMCSIT), Proceedings of the 2010 International Multiconference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;419-428;NULO;2157-5525;Excluir
1104;BESS OR XBEST: MINING THE MALAYSIAN ONLINE REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Samsudin, N.a  and Puteh, M.a  and Hamdan, A.R.b;2011;Advancement in information and technology facilities especially the Internet has changed the way we communicate and express opinions or sentiments on services or products that we consume. Opinion mining aims to automate the process of mining opinions into the positive or the negative views. It will benefit both the customers and the sellers in identifying the best product or service. Although there are researchers that explore new techniques of identifying the sentiment polarization, few works have been done on opinion mining created by the Malaysian reviewers. The same scenario happens to micro-text. Therefore in this study, we conduct an exploratory research on opinion mining of online movie reviews collected from several forums and blogs written by the Malaysian. The experiment data are tested using machine learning classifiers i.e. Support VectorMachine, Nave Baiyes and k-Nearest Neighbor. The result illustrates that the performance of these machine learning techniques without any preprocessing of the micro-texts or feature selection is quite low. Therefore additional steps are required in order to mine the opinions from these data.

This technology allows users to share reviews about entities of interest without any delay, using mobile devices. This paper builds on the previous work on textual sentiment analysis to investigate whether information in the speech signal can be used to predict sentiment from short spoken reviews. For this purpose we collected a short spoken reviews from 84 speakers. Results show that models trained on features characterizing the reviews pitch significantly outperform a majority class baseline, without textual information. When taking text-based sentiment predictions into account, our results suggest that prosody can alleviate the effect of speech recognition errors on sentiment detection, however a larger dataset is needed to test whether this can be done without harming performance on low word error rates.;Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2012 IEEE International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;5093-5096;10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289066;1520-6149;Excluir
1106;CHINESE SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION USING A NEURAL NETWORK TOOL #X2014:, WORD2VEC;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zengcai Su and Hua Xu and Dongwen Zhang and Yunfeng Xu;2014;Sentiment classification is the main and popular task in the field of sentiment analysis. Most of the existing researches focus on how to extract the effective features, such as lexical features and syntactic features, while limited work has been done on the extraction of semantic features, which can make more contributions to sentiment classification. This paper presents a method for sentiment classification based on word2vec. Word2vec is a tool, which establishes the neural network models to learn the vector representations of words in the high dimensional vector space. So it can extract the deep semantic relationships between words. In this paper, firstly, we cluster the similar features together using word2vec. And then we use word2vec again to learn the word representations as candidate feature vectors. After feature selection, the SVMperf package is adopted to train and classify the comment texts. To conduct the experiments, we collect a large number of Chinese comments on clothing products as data set. The experimental results show that the accuracy of sentiment classification is over 90 percent, which proves the effectiveness of proposed method for Chinese sentiment classification.;Multisensor Fusion and Information Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI), 2014 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1-6;10.1109/MFI.2014.6997687;NULO;Excluir

To represent sentence subjectivity, we calculate sentiment density using the extracted subjective cues and thus construct a set of sentiment density subintervals.

Hence it is required to classify the reviews from balanced data sets for analysis and opinion mining of any applications. The reason for considering balanced data sets is that the decision will not be biased on the category of reviews considered.

1109;CLOPINIONMINER: OPINION TARGET EXTRACTION IN A CROSS-LANGUAGE SCENARIO;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zhou, X. and Wan, X. and Xiao, J.;2015;Opinion target extraction is a subtask of opinion mining which is very useful in many applications. The problem has usually been solved by training a sequence labeler on manually labeled data. However, the labeled training datasets are imbalanced in different languages, and the lack of labeled corpus in a language limits the research progress on opinion target extraction in this language. In order to address the above problem, we propose a novel system called CLOpinionMiner which investigates leveraging the rich labeled data in a source language for opinion target extraction in a different target language. In this study, we focus on English-to-Chinese cross-language opinion target extraction. Based on the English dataset, our method produces two Chinese training datasets with different features. Two labeling models for Chinese opinion target extraction are trained based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF). After that, we use a monolingual co-training algorithm to improve the performance of both models by leveraging the enormous unlabeled Chinese review texts on the web.

1110;CO-EXTRACTING OPINION TARGETS AND OPINION WORDS FROM ONLINE REVIEWS BASED ON THE WORD ALIGNMENT MODEL;IEEE_B;IEEE;Kang Liu and Liheng Xu and Jun Zhao;2015;Mining opinion targets and opinion words from online reviews are important tasks for fine-grained opinion mining, the key component of which involves detecting opinion relations among words. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the partially-supervised alignment model, which regards identifying opinion relations as an alignment process. Then, a graph-based co-ranking algorithm is exploited to estimate the confidence of each candidate. Finally, candidates with higher confidence are extracted as opinion targets or opinion words. Compared to previous methods based on the nearest-neighbor rules, our model captures opinion relations more precisely, especially for long-span relations. Compared to syntax-based methods, our word alignment model effectively alleviates the negative effects of parsing errors when dealing with informal online texts. In particular, compared to the traditional unsupervised alignment model, the proposed model obtains better precision because of the usage of partial supervision. In addition, when estimating candidate confidence, we penalize higher-degree vertices in our graph-based co-ranking algorithm to decrease the probability of error generation. Our experimental results on three corpora with different sizes and languages show that our approach effectively outperforms state-of-the-art methods.;Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on;NULO;NULO;27;636-650;10.1109/TKDE.2014.2339850;1041-4347;Excluir
1111;COLLABORATIVE FILTERING WITH ASPECT-BASED OPINION MINING: A TENSOR FACTORIZATION APPROACH;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;Wang, Yuanhong and Liu, Yang and Yu, Xiaohui;2012;Collaborative filtering (CF) aims to produce user specific recommendations based on other users ratings of items. Most existing CF methods rely only on users overall ratings of items, ignoring the variety of opinions users may have towards different aspects of the items. Using the movie domain as a case study, we propose a framework that is able to capture users opinions on different aspects from the textual reviews, and use that information to improve the effectiveness of CF. This framework has two components, an opinion mining component and a rating inference component. The former extracts and summarizes the opinions on multiple aspects from the reviews, generating ratings on the various aspects. The latter component, on the other hand, infers the overall ratings of items based on the aspect ratings, which forms the basis for item recommendation. Our core contribution is in the proposal of a tensor factorization approach for the rating inference. Operating on the tensor composed of the overall and aspect ratings, this approach is able to capture the intrinsic relationships between users, items, and aspects, and provide accurate predictions on unknown ratings. Experiments on a movie dataset show that our proposal significantly improves the prediction accuracy compared with two baseline methods.;12th Ieee International Conference on Data Mining (Icdm 2012);Journal Article;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000316383800140;NULO;1152-1157;10.1109/icdm.2012.76;1550-4786;Incluir

This method considers explicit ratings and implicit opinions, an action that can address the problem of data sparseness.

1120;COMPONENT ANALYSIS OF A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ON DIFFERENT CORPORA;IEEE_B;IEEE;Medhat, W. and Yousef, A.H. and Mohamed, H.K.;2014;Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the computational study of peoples opinions about certain topics. With the massive growth of web 2.0 technologies, many sources of data and corpora are available for SA. There are some recent frameworks proposed in this field that can deal with different corpora. This paper presents a component analysis of recently proposed sentiment analysis framework. The framework components are divided to three stages, each of which contains many alternatives. The first stage is the text processing which include handling negations, removing stopwords, and using selective words of part-of-speech tags. The second stage is the feature extractions which are unigrams and bigrams. The third stage is the text classification which was done using Nai¨ve Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers. It is important to analyze the components of the framework to configure which scenario is better for each corpus used. The analysis is enhanced by applying the framework components on the benchmark corpus movie reviews in addition to the prepared corpora from online social network sites and a review site. The results show that applying all the stages of text processing techniques ultimately decrease the classifiers training time with no significant penalty in accuracy. The results also show that Nai¨ve Bayes gives higher accuracy in case of balanced benchmark corpus while Decision tree classifier is better for imbalance data from social network.;Computer Engineering Systems (ICCES), 2014 9th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;300-306;10.1109/ICCES.2014.7030976;NULO;Incluir

The number of customer reviews that a product receives is growing at a very fast rate (It could be in hundreds or thousands). Opinion mining from product reviews, forum posts and blogs is an important research topic today with many applications. However, existing research is more focused towards classification and summarization of these online opinions. An important issue related to the trustworthiness of online opinions has been neglected most often. There is no reported study on assessing the trustworthiness of reviews, which is crucial for all opinion based applications, although web spam and email spam have been investigated extensively. In this paper, we make an attempt to detect whether a review is a spam or a non spam review, in order to provide a trusted review to help the customer in taking the proper buying decision. The trustworthiness of the reviews is assessed as spam or a non spam review which includes both duplicate and near duplicate reviews classified as spam reviews, and partially related and unique reviews classified as non spam reviews. We propose a novel and effective technique, namely, Conceptual level similarity measure used for detecting spam reviews based on the product features that have been commented in the reviews. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting spam and non spam reviews. The efficiency of the task of web based customer review spam detection can be enhanced by identifying and eliminating duplicate and near duplicate spam reviews, thereby providing a summary of the trusted reviews for customers to make buying decisions.;Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP), 2010 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;416-423;10.1109/ICSIP.2010.5697509;NULO;Excluir
1122;CONFIDENCE ESTIMATION AND REPUTATION ANALYSIS IN ASPECT EXTRACTION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Li, Y. and Wang, H. and Qin, Z. and Xu, W. and Guo, J.;2014;Extracting product aspects and their associated sentiments is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. Estimating the confidences of extracted aspects is important to ensure the performance. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a two-step estimation method. Collocations of product features and opinion words are initially extracted through pattern bootstrapping. A criterion synthesizing two measurements, Popularity and Reliability, is novelly exploited to assess both patterns and features. Then the features are further clustered into aspects based on path similarities in the Word Net. Each cluster is assigned a weight based on its Compactness and Texture, and the light ones are filtered out. In addition, this paper also captures global aspect reputations by aggregating sentiment strengths through opinion collocations. Experimental results on a benchmark data set with 5 products demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our proposed method.;Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition;Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84919917570&partnerID=40&md5=a6af26459953d66f1d872cc80446ae6f;NULO;3612-3617;10.1109/ICPR.2014.621;NULO;Incluir

1124;CREDIBILITY EVALUATION AND RESULTS WITH LEADER-WEIGHT IN OPINION MINING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Cho, K.S. and Ryu, J.-S. and Jeong, J.-H. and Kim, Y.-H. and Kim, U.-M.;2010;A plethora of information is recently flooding the Internet with a rapid surge in Internet usage. Information easily available on the Internet help researchers understand people they study. The existing techniques of the opinion mining usually consist of sentiment classification, feature-based opinion mining, summarization, comparative sentence and relation mining, opinion search, opinion spam, and the linguistic dictionary construction such as the WordNet. This paper, however, proposes differing methods of opinion mining from existing ones. The methods we present here enable credibility evaluation and result conversion using influence of each opinion holder on the Internet and their personal information, which are an analysis-result of LIWC, including their background information and tendency.

1125;CRF BASED ON LHFS APPLIED ON SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Zhu, J.;2012;Sentiment classification has attracted increasing interest from natural language processing. This paper applies CRF(Conditional Random Filed) based on LHFS (Local High-Frequency Strings) method on sentence sentiment analysis. This method can effectively solve ordinal regression problems. In this method, sentences are labeled to determine their polarity, and LHFS method is used to expand the set of sentiment features. Experiments on sentiment classification indicate that the accuracy of CRF model is increased up to 2.1%, with the help of LHFS method, which is much better than that of HMM and MEMM.

1127;CROSS-DOMAIN SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION USING A SENTIMENT SENSITIVE THESAURUS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Bollegala, D. and Weir, D. and Carroll, J.;2013;Automatic classification of sentiment is important for numerous applications such as opinion mining, opinion summarization, contextual advertising, and market analysis. Typically, sentiment classification has been modeled as the problem of training a binary classifier using reviews annotated for positive or negative sentiment. However, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is costly. Applying a sentiment classifier trained using labeled data for a particular domain to classify sentiment of user reviews on a different domain often results in poor performance because words that occur in the train (source) domain might not appear in the test (target) domain. We propose a method to overcome this problem in cross-domain sentiment classification. First, we create a sentiment sensitive distributional thesaurus using labeled data for the source domains and unlabeled data for both source and target domains. Sentiment sensitivity is achieved in the thesaurus by incorporating document level sentiment labels in the context vectors used as the basis for measuring the distributional similarity between words. Next, we use the created thesaurus to expand feature vectors during train and test times in a binary classifier. The proposed method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are comparable with previously proposed cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark data set containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed method on single- and multisource domain adaptation, unsupervised and supervised domain adaptation, and numerous similarity measures for creating the sentiment sensitive thesaurus. Moreover, our comparisons against the SentiWordNet, a lexical resource for word polarity, show that the created sentiment-sensitive thesaurus accurately captures words that express similar s- ntiments.;Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on;NULO;NULO;25;1719-1731;10.1109/TKDE.2012.103;1041-4347;Excluir
1128;CROSS-LANGUAGE OPINION TARGET EXTRACTION IN REVIEW TEXTS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Xinjie Zhou and Xiaojun Wan and Jianguo Xiao;2012;Opinion target extraction is a subtask of opinion mining which is very useful in many applications. In this study, we investigate the problem in a cross-language scenario which leverages the rich labeled data in a source language for opinion target extraction in a different target language. The English labeled corpus is used as training set. We generate two Chinese training datasets with different features. Two labeling models for Chinese opinion target extraction are learned based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF). After that, we use a monolingual co-training algorithm to improve the performance of both models by leveraging the enormous unlabeled Chinese review texts on the web. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.;Data Mining (ICDM), 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1200-1205;10.1109/ICDM.2012.32;1550-4786;Excluir
1129;DATA REPRESENTATION IN MACHINE LEARNING-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Shamshurin, I.;2011;In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting opinions from natural language texts, which is one of the tasks of sentiment analysis. We provide an overview of existing approaches to sentiment analysis including supervised (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and SVM) and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply three supervised learning methods-Naive Bayes, KNN, and a method based on the Jaccard index - to the dataset of Internet user reviews about cars and report the results. When learning a user opinion on a specific feature of a car such as speed or comfort, it turns out that training on full unprocessed reviews decreases the classification accuracy. We experiment with different approaches to preprocessing reviews in order to obtain representations that are relevant for the feature one wants to learn and show the effect of each representation on the accuracy of classification.

1130;DATA-DRIVEN VS. DICTIONARY-BASED WORD N-GRAM FEATURE INDUCTION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Remus, R.a  and Rill, S.b  c;2013;We address the question which word n-gram feature induction approach yields the most accurate discriminative model for machine learning-based sentiment analysis within a specific domain: a purely data-driven word n-gram feature induction or a word n-gram feature induction based on a domain-specific or domain-non-specific polarity dictionary. We evaluate both approaches in document-level polarity classification experiments in 2 languages, English and German, for 4 analog domains each: user-written product reviews on books, DVDs, electronics and music. We conclude that while dictionary-based feature induction leads to large dimensionality reductions, purely data-driven feature induction yields more accurate discriminative models.

1132;DEPENDENCY FOREST FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Tu, Z. and Jiang, W. and Liu, Q. and Lin, S.;2012;Dependency Grammars prove to be effective in improving sentiment analysis, because they can directly capture syntactic relations between words. However, most dependency-based systems suffer from a major drawback: they only use 1-best dependency trees for feature extraction, which adversely affects the performance due to parsing errors. Therefore, we propose an approach that applies dependency forest to sentiment analysis. A dependency forest compactly represents multiple dependency trees. We develop new algorithms for extracting features from dependency forest. Experiments show that our forest-based system obtains 5.4 point absolute improvement in accuracy over a bag-of-words system, and 1.3 point improvement over a tree-based system on a widely used sentiment dataset. Our forest-based system also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the sentiment dataset.

Now, people buy a product and express their opinion in social media so that other people can acquire knowledge about that product before they proceed to buy it. On the other hand, for the companies it has become necessary to keep track of the public opinions on their products to achieve customer satisfaction. Therefore, nowadays opinion mining is a routine task for every company for developing a widely acceptable product or providing satisfactory service. Concept-based opinion mining is a new area of research. The key parts of this research involve extraction of concepts from the text, determining product aspects, and identifying sentiment associated with these aspects. In this paper, we address each one of these tasks using a novel approach that takes text as input and use dependency parse tree-based rules to extract concepts and aspects and identify the associated sentiment.

1134;DERIVING QUANTITATIVE OVERVIEWS OF FREE TEXT ASSESSMENTS ON THE WEB;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Chklovski, T.;2006;Many research efforts are addressing the problem of enabling automatic summarization of opinions and assessments stated on the web in product reviews, discussion forums, and blogs. One key difficulty is that relevant assessments scattered throughout web pages are obscured by variations in natural language. In this paper, we focus on a novel aspect of enabling aggregations of assessments of degree to which a given property holds for a given entity (for instance, how touristy is Boston). We present GrainPile, a user interface for extracting from the web, aggregating and quantifying degree assessments of unconstrained topics. The interface provides a variety of functions: a) identification of dimensions of comparison (properties) relevant to a particular entity or set of entities, b) comparisons of like entities on user-specified properties (for example, which university is more prestigious, Yale or Cornell), c) tracing the derived opinions back to their sources (so that the reasons for the opinions can be found). A central contribution in GrainPile is the evaluated demonstration of feasibility of mapping the recognized expressions (such as fairly, very, extremely, and so on) to a common scale of numerical values and aggregating across all the extracted assessments to derive an overall assessment of degree. GrainPiles novel assessment and aggregation of degree expressions is shown to strongly outperform an interpretation-free, co-occurrence based method.

1135;DESIGNING AN INTEGRATED SEMANTIC FRAMEWORK FOR STRUCTURED OPINION SUMMARIZATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Asgarian, E. and Kahani, M.;2014;Knowing about peoples opinions and viewpoints plays an essential role in decision-making processes involving regular customers to executive managers. Therefore, in the past decade, with the advent of Web 2.0, a new orientation of natural language processing science called opinion mining has been emerged. The main problem of exploring feature-level opinions is the complexity of feature extraction and its relations with the words containing the sentiment within unstructured texts, which reduces the accuracy of opinion mining. The purpose of the structured opinion summarization is to demonstrate the mentioned features in the reviews and express the sentiment value of users for each feature, quantitatively. The main idea of this research is to consider the semantic (knowledge) to analyze the sentiment in the review by developing the opinion ontology. Therefore, a semantic framework as an integrated method is proposed in all stages of feature-based opinion summarization.

1136;DETECTING CHANGES OF OPINION FROM CUSTOMER REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Li-Chen Cheng and Zhi-Han Ke and Bang-Min Shiue;2011;With the flourishing of the world wide web, the online customer review process is becoming more and more useful and important as an information resource for people. As a result, opinion mining research for analysis of opinion data on the web has recently become a popular topic. Most previous studies have used Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to predict the opinion (positive or negative). This study first proposes a method which combines the associative classification methodology with the overall rating to discover the relation of the features. By the way, a framework is also proposed to discover those changes of opinion that can identify the users opinion of a product. Experimental results, in mining ipad review information, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The data set used contains actual WOM information from which to study the dynamic patterns of users changing opinions.

1137;DETECTING GENERAL OPINIONS FROM CUSTOMER SURVEYS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Stepanov, E.A. and Riccardi, G.;2011;Questionnaire-based surveys and on-line product reviews resemble each other in that they both have user comments and satisfaction ratings. Since a comment might be a general opinion about a product or only one or a set of its attributes, in which case the text might not reflect the rating, surveys and reviews share the problem of pairing free-text comments with these ratings. To train accurate models for automatic evaluation of products from free-text, it is important to distinguish these two kinds of opinions. In this paper we present experiments on detecting general opinions that target a product as a whole, thus, reflect the user sentiments better. The task is different from subjectivity detection, since the goal is to detect generality of an opinion regardless of the rest of the documents being opinionated or not. The task complements feature-based opinion analysis and opinion polarity classification, since it can be applied as a preceding step to both tasks. We show that when used as a classification feature user ratings are not useful in the general opinion detection task. However, they are effective in predicting the polarity of a comment once it is identified as a general opinion.;Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;115-122;10.1109/ICDMW.2011.63;NULO;Incluir

Sentiment analysis can be used for grouping search engine results, analyzing news content, reviews for books, movie, sports, blogs, web forums, etc. Several methods have been proposed for sentiment analysis at word, sentence, and document levels mostly based on common machine learning techniques. In this paper we explore a new methodology for sentiment analysis by considering a new set of features based on word proximities in a written text. We propose three proximity-based features, namely, proximity distribution, mutual information between proximity types, and proximity patterns. We applied this approach to the analysis of movie reviews, drug reviews, and music reviews. Our experimental results show that proximity-based sentiment analysis is able to extract sentiments from a specific domain, with performance comparable to the state-of-the-art.

We define antagonism as a new class of textual opinions - direct sentiment towards the authors of previous comments. We detect the negative sentiment using aspect-based opinion mining techniques. We create a model of human behavior in online communities, based on the network topology and on the communication content. The model contains seven hypotheses, which validate two intuitions. The first intuition is that the content of the messages exchanged in an online community can separate good and insightful contributions from the rest. The second intuition is that there is a delay until the network stabilizes and until standard measures, such as betweenness centrality, can be used accurately. Taken together, these intuitions are a solid case for using the content of the communication along with network measures. We show that the sentiment within the messages, especially antagonism, can significantly alter the community perception. We use real world data, taken from the Slash dot discussion forum to validate our model. All the findings are accompanied by extremely significant t-test p-values.;Social Computing (SocialCom), 2013 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;142-147;10.1109/SocialCom.2013.28;NULO;Incluir
1140;DISCOVERING AND MONITORING PRODUCT FEATURES AND THE OPINIONS ON THEM WITH OPINSTREAM;SCIENCE_DIRECT;SCIENCE_DIRECT;Max Zimmermann and Eirini Ntoutsi and Myra Spiliopoulou;2015;Abstract Opinion stream mining encompasses methods for monitoring and understanding how people×³s attitude towards products changes over time. For many applications, though, not only a specific product is of interest but also the properties that people consider important for the whole category of products. Understanding which product features influence a buyer×³s choice positively or negatively allows decision makers to make well-informed decisions on improving their products or marketing them properly. In this study, we propose OPINSTREAM, a framework for the discovery and polarity monitoring of implicit product features deemed important in the people×³s reviews on different products. Our framework encompasses stream clustering, extraction of product features from the clusters, cluster adaptation and semi-supervised sentiment learning inside each cluster.

Starting from a hierarchical compositional method for generating sentence ratings, we expand the model by adding multi-word terms that can capture non-compositional semantics. The method operates similarly to a bigram language model, using bigram terms or backing off to unigrams based on a (degree of) compositionality criterion. The affective ratings for n-gram terms of different orders are estimated via a corpus-based method using distributional semantic similarity metrics between unseen words and a set of seed words. N-gram ratings are then combined into sentence ratings via simple algebraic formulas. The proposed framework produces state-of-the-art results for word-level tasks in English and German and the sentence-level news headlines classification SemEval07-Task14 task. The inclusion of bigram terms to the model provides significant performance improvement, even if no term selection is applied.;Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, IEEE Transactions on;NULO;NULO;21;2379-2392;10.1109/TASL.2013.2277931;1558-7916;Incluir
1142;DIVIDING FOR COMBINATION: A BOOTSTRAPPING SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK FOR MICRO-BLOGS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Songxian Xie and Ting Wang;2013;There are many challenges for sentiment classification of user-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms such as micro-blogs. Context dependence, which has been the most challenging problem, is focused on in this paper, and a novel semi-supervised framework is proposed to address the problem. By dividing the feature space of sentiment classification into two parts including the general features and the context features, a general classifier and a context classifier are learned separately in the two partial feature spaces, and a semi-supervised framework is developed to combine the general classifier and context classifier into a bootstrapping classifier. Experimental results show that both the general classifier and context classifier outperform traditional lexicon-based classifier, and the combined bootstrapping classifier outperforms supervised classifier upper bound. The proposed semi-supervised framework is flexible and effective in solving the context dependent problem of sentiment classification for micro-blogs without the need of labeled data.;Information Science and Cloud Computing (ISCC), 2013 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;78-84;10.1109/ISCC.2013.18;NULO;Incluir
1143;DOCUMENT SIMILARITY ESTIMATION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING NEURAL NETWORK;IEEE_B;IEEE;Yanagimoto, H. and Shimada, M. and Yoshimura, A.;2013;It is important to classify documents according to their contents because of finding necessary documents efficiently. To achieve good classification document similarity estimation is one of key techniques since classification is executed based on the document similarity. In natural language processing bag-of-words model is used to extract features from documents and term occurrence frequency based value is used as a weight of each features. However, the term weight methodologies usually use predefined models and include some limitations. New approaches to construct feature vectors based on data distribution are desired to achieve high performance of natural language processing. These days many researchers pay attention to deep learning. Deep learning is a new approach to transform raw data to feature vectors using many unlabeled data. This characteristics is desirable to satisfy a previous need. In natural language processing a main aim is to construct a language model on a deep architecture neural network. In this paper we use a deep architecture neural network to estimate document similarity. To obtain good article similarity estimation we have to generate good article vectors that can represent all article characteristics. Hence, we use many stock market news to train the deep architecture neural network and generate article vectors with the trained neural network. And we calculate cosine similarity between labeled articles and discuss performance of the deep architecture neural network.

1144;DYNAMIC USER PROFILE GENERATION BY MINING USER OPINION;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;Banati, Hema and Bajaj, Monika and Asme;2011;User opinion has always played a pivotal role in strategy formulation for commercial organizations. However, due to rapid technological changes and increased competition, it is imperative for the organizations to ensure a quick and latest collection of consumer preferences. Web media has provided a distinct and comfortable way of expression of consumer opinion on specific products online. These opinions are reflective of user preferences. The features of the product explicitly mentioned in reviews indicate the inclination of the user for those features. The paper presents a distinct way to mine the opinions and implicitly capture the user interest, thus generating a dynamic user profile which reflects the changing interests of the user. The collected opinions are preprocessed and prepared for extracting the product features by applying linguistic rules. The approach further prunes these to identify the relevant features which can subsequently be considered for dynamic user profile generation. Experimental study of the algorithm was conducted on different products and the results reveal the effectiveness of proposed feature extraction algorithm at each level.;NULO;Book;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000320340300085;NULO;557-562;NULO;978-0-7918-5973-5;Incluir
1145;E-BUSINESS WEBSITES EVALUATION BASED ON OPINION MINING;IEEE_B;IEEE;Weiping Wang and Yuanzhuang Zhou;2009;With the popularization and development of Internet, as a new business methodology, e-business Web sites are attracting the attention of public and springing with fierce competition. How to make the Web sites invincible and how to help the potential customers make decisions? The only way is to make a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the sites. Many traditional approaches have done this job, which are mostly qualitative and subjective. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on opinion mining. Through the reviews customers have posted we can mining the evaluation of various Web site indexes quantitatively. To improve the accuracy of the mining results we use a approach called MRA (mutual reinforcement approach). Different from the vast majority of opinion mining methods centering on mining explicit factor-opinion pairs, the MRA can mining implicit pairs effectively based on a pre-constructed association set. The biggest flash point of our evaluation approach is that it is customer-oriented and therefore more credible and trustworthy than traditional approach. The experimental study and evaluation show that the results by the proposed approach are consistent with the traditional approach but more reliable.;Electronic Commerce and Business Intelligence, 2009.

1146;EFFECTIVE COMMENT SENTENCE RECOGNITION FOR FEATURE-BASED OPINION MINING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Song, H. and Yang, B. and Liu, X.;2013;Feature-based opinion mining aims to extract fine-grained comments in product features level from the product reviews. Previous work proposed a lot of statistics-based and model-based approaches. However, the extraction result is not satisfying when these methods are actually used into an application with large useless data due to the complexity of Chinese. Through analyzing the samples hadnt been extracted correctly, we found some extracting patterns or models have been misused on the useless sentences which lead to wrong extraction. This paper focuses on improving the POS-pattern match methodology. The core idea of our approach is picking out the effective comment sentences before feature and sentiment extraction based on neural network training. Three attributes of sentences are selected to learn the classification algorithm. Experiment gives the superior parameters of the algorithm. We report the classification performance and also compare the feature extraction performance with classification process and not. The result on practical data set demonstrates the effect of this approach.

1148;EMOTIONAL DESCRIPTORS AND QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE (QOE) METRICS IN EVALUATING MEDIATED LEARNING;IEEE_B;IEEE;Kotsakis, R. and Dimoulas, C.A. and Kalliris, G. and Veglis, A.;2014;The present paper focuses on the extraction and evaluation of salient audiovisual features for the prediction of the encoding requirements in multimedia learning content. Decisions over audiovisual encoding are related to the perceived quality of experience (QoE), but also to the physical attributes of initial material (i.e. resolution, color range, motion activity, audio dynamic range, bandwidth, etc.). Recent research showed that such decisions can be really crucial during the production of audiovisual e-learning material, where poor encoding may lead to unaccepted QoE or even to the creation of negative emotional response. On the other hand, exaggerated high quality encoding may create increased bandwidth demands that are associated with annoying delays and irregular playback flow, resulting again in QoE degradation with similar emotional repulsion. Thus, there has to be a careful treatment with proper encoding balance during the production of both the networked distance learning and stand-alone audiovisual mediated resources. Such machine creativity strategies are investigated in the current work with the utilization of applicable audiovisual features, QoE metrics and emotional measures. The current work is part of a broader research, aiming at implementing intelligent models for optimal audiovisual production and encoding configuration, with respect to the source content attributes, the requested quality of experience (and learning) and the related emotional properties.;Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications, IISA 2014, The 5th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;232-237;10.1109/IISA.2014.6878744;NULO;Excluir

The key motivation of sentiment analysis is getting to know what consumers think about products and services by analyzing their opinions on online portals, blogs, discussion boards, reviews etc. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the information of POS-based sentiment-rich phrases in a machine-learning algorithm that determines the semantic orientation of a given text. In this paper, bi-tagged phrases are used as features in combination with unigram features for sentiment classification. Joint feature vectors of unigrams and bi-tagged phrases have high dimensions consisting of noisy and irrelevant features. Therefore, a feature selection method is used to select only relevant features from the feature vector. Experimental results show that the combination of prominent unigrams and bi-tagged phrases outperforms other features for sentiment classification in a movie review dataset.;Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;892-895;10.1109/ICDMW.2013.80;NULO;Incluir

1155;EVALUATING FEATURE SETS AND CLASSIFIERS FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL NEWS;ACM;ACM;Nj{\o}lstad, P{\aa}l Christian S. and H{\o}ys{\ae}ter, Lars S. and Wei, Wei and Gulla, Jon Atle;2014;Work on sentiment analysis has thus far been limited in the news article domain. This has mainly been caused by 1) news articles lacking a clearly defined target, 2) the difficulty in separating good and bad news from positive and negative sentiment, and 3) the seeming necessity of, and complexity in, relying on domain-specific interpretations and background knowledge. In this paper we propose, define, experiment with, and evaluate, four different feature categories, composed of 26 article features, for sentiment analysis. Using five different machine learning methods, we train sentiment classifiers of Norwegian financial internet news articles, and achieve classification precisions up to ~71%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art in other domains and close to the human baseline. Our experimentation with different feature subsets shows that the category relying on domain-specific sentiment lexical (contextual category), able to grasp the jargon and lingo used in Norwegian financial news, is of cardinal importance in classification - these features yield a precision increase of ~21% when added to the other feature categories. When comparing different machine learning classifiers, we find J48 classification trees to yield the highest performance, closely followed by Random Forests (RF), in line with recent studies, and in opposition to the antedated conception that Support Vector Machines (SVM) is superior in this domain.;Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT) - Volume 02;NULO;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.82;NULO;71--78;10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.82;978-1-4799-4143-8-02;Incluir

However, it is hard, if not impossible, to collect and maintain a universal sentiment lexicon for all application domains because different words may be used in different domains. The main existing technique extracts such sentiment words from a large domain corpus based on different conjunctions and the idea of sentiment coherency in a sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel propagation approach that exploits the relations between sentiment words and topics or product features that the sentiment words modify, and also sentiment words and product features themselves to extract new sentiment words. As the method propagates information through both sentiment words and features, we call it double propagation. The extraction rules are designed based on relations described in dependency trees. A new method is also proposed to assign polarities to newly discovered sentiment words in a domain. Experimental results show that our approach is able to extract a large number of new sentiment words.

Traditional approaches of text sentiment analysis typically work at a particular level, such as phrase, sentence or document level, which might not be suitable for the documents with too few or too many words. Considering every level analysis has its own advantages, we expect that a combination model may achieve better performance. In this paper, a novel combined model based on phrase and sentence levels analyses and a discussion on the complementation of different levels analyses are presented. For the phrase-level sentiment analysis, a newly defined Left-Middle-Right template and the Conditional Random Fields are used to extract the sentiment words. The Maximum Entropy model is used in the sentence-level sentiment analysis.

The complete meaning of a sentence is not only determined by the meaning of words, but also by the pattern in which words are arranged. Essentially each word in a sentence possesses grammatical corporations with other words for correct utterance of meaning, such corporations between words is called binary grammatical relation or dependency (BGD). We believe that the analysis of a sentence on the basis of grammatical dependencies among the words is very useful for application such as opinion mining (OM) from a domain specific free format product reviews. Such free format reviews are largely available on Web due to presence of many e-commerce sites. Because of unavailability of universal resources (e.g. opinion word lexicon and feature corpus) for all application domains, OM becomes a very challenging job. OM from free format product reviews mainly deals with extraction of domain specific features, identification of opinion words corresponding to each features and determination of semantic orientation (SO) of opinion of words (e.g. large, small, loud, etc), which does not belong to set prior polarity opinion words (e.g. beautiful, excellent, good, etc.).

A new approach of OFESP (Opinion Feature Extraction based on Sentiment Patterns) is proposed in this paper, which takes into account the structure characteristics of reviews for higher values of precision and recall. With a self-constructed database of sentiment patterns, OFESP matches each review sentence to obtain its features, and then filters redundant features regarding relevance of the domain, statistics and semantic similarity. Experimental studies on real-world data demonstrate that as compared with the traditional method based on a window mechanism, OFESP outperforms it on precision, recall and F-score. Meanwhile, in comparison to the approach based on syntactic analysis, OFESP performs better on recall and F-score.;Information Networking and Automation (ICINA), 2010 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;1;V1-115-V1-119;10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636422;NULO;Incluir

1171;EXTRACTING OPINIONATED (SUB) FEATURES FROM A STREAM OF PRODUCT REVIEWS;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;Zimmermann, Max and Ntoutsi, Eirini and Spiliopoulou, Myra;2013;We propose a stream mining method that learns opinionated product features from a stream of reviews. Monitoring the attitude of customers towards products is a field of much interest, but the products themselves may come in and out of the market. We rather investigate which (implicit) features of the products are important for the customers, and monitor how customer attitude towards such features evolves. To this purpose, we use a two-level stream clustering algorithm that extracts features and subfeatures from an opinionated stream, and couple it with dedicated feature-specific classifiers that assess the polarity of each extracted (sub) feature. We evaluate our method on a stream of reviews and we elaborate on how changes in the arrival rate of features (drift) affects algorithm performance.;Discovery Science;Book Section;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000340562100023;8140;340-355;NULO;0302-9743978-3-642-40897-7/ 978-3-642-40896-0;Incluir
1172;EXTRACTING PROBLEMATIC API FEATURES FROM FORUM DISCUSSIONS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Yingying Zhang and Daqing Hou;2013;Software engineering activities often produce large amounts of unstructured data. Useful information can be extracted from such data to facilitate software development activities, such as bug reports management and documentation provision. Online forums, in particular, contain extensive valuable information that can aid in software development. However, no work has been done to extract problematic API features from online forums. In this paper, we investigate ways to extract problematic API features that are discussed as a source of difficulty in each thread, using natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques. Based on a preliminary manual analysis of the content of a discussion thread and a categorization of the role of each sentence therein, we decide to focus on a negative sentiment sentence and its close neighbors as a unit for extracting API features. We evaluate a set of candidate solutions by comparing tool-extracted problematic API design features with manually produced golden test data. Our best solution yields a precision of 89%. We have also investigated three potential applications for our feature extraction solution: (i) highlighting the negative sentence and its neighbors to help illustrate the main API feature:, (ii) searching helpful online information using the extracted API feature as a query:, (iii) summarizing the problematic features to reveal the hot topics in a forum.;Program Comprehension (ICPC), 2013 IEEE 21st International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;142-151;10.1109/ICPC.2013.6613842;1063-6897;Excluir

Online product reviews is considered as a significant informative resource which is useful for both potential customers and product manufacturers. The task of manually scanning through large amounts of review one by one is computational burden and is not practically implemented with respect to businesses and customer perspectives. Therefore it is more efficient to automatically process the various reviews and provide the necessary information in a suitable form. The task of product feature and opinion is to find product features that customers refer to their topic reviews. It would be useful to characterize the opinions about product. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract product features and to identify the opinions associated with these features from reviews through syntactic information based on dependency analysis.

1174;EXTRACTING PRODUCT FEATURES FROM CHINESE CUSTOMER REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Yu Zheng and Liang Ye and Geng-feng Wu and Xin Li;2008;E-commerce, or business done on the Internet has become more and more popular. Meanwhile, the number of customer reviews for products on the internet grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds. As a result, the problem of Â¿opinion miningÂ¿ has seen increasing attention over several years. In this paper, we proposed a statistical method to extract product features from Chinese customer reviews. The method is based on distribution of a candidate word in different domains and within the certain domain. It also takes into account the unbalance size of different product reviews. Experimental results show that it achieves better performance than other methods.;Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering, 2008.

1176;EXTRACTING SERVICE ASPECTS FROM WEB REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Hao, J.a  and Li, S.b  and Chen, Z.b;2010;Web users have published huge amounts of opinions about services in blogs, Web forums and other review friendly social websites. Consumers form their judgements to service quality according to a variety of service aspects which may be mentioned in different Web reviews. The research challenge is how to extract service aspects from service related Web reviews for conducting automatic service quality evaluation. To address this problem, this paper proposes four different methods to extract service aspects. Two methods are unsupervised methods and the other two methods are supervised methods. In the first method, we use FP-tree to find frequent aspects. The second method is graph-based method. We employ state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as CRFs (Conditional Random Fields) and MLN (Markov Logic Network) to extract service aspects. Experimental results show graph-based method outperforms FP-tree method. We also find that MLN performs well compared to other three methods.

1178;EXTRACTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND RANKING OF NETWORK STRUCTURES FROM DATA SETS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Trovati, M. and Bessis, N. and Huber, A. and Zelenkauskaite, A. and Asimakopoulou, E.;2014;Networks are widely used to model a variety of complex, often multi-disciplinary, systems in which the relationships between their sub-parts play a significant role. In particular, there is extensive research on the topological properties associated with their structure as this allows the analysis of the overall behaviour of such networks. However, extracting networks from structured and unstructured data sets raises several challenges, including addressing any inconsistency present in the data, as well as the difficulty in investigating their properties especially when the topological structure is not fully determined or not explicitly defined. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address the automated identification, assessment and ranking of the most likely structure associated with networks extracted from a variety of data sets. More specifically, our approach allows to mine data to assess whether their associated networks exhibit properties comparable to well-known structures, namely scale-free, small world and random networks. The main motivation is to provide a toolbox to classify and analyse real-world networks otherwise difficult to fully assess due to their potential lack of structure. This can be used to investigate their dynamical and statistical behaviour which would potentially lead to a better understanding and prediction of the properties of the system (s) they model.

This large amount of information on web platforms make them viable for use as data sources, in applications based on opinion mining and sentiment analysis. In this paper we propose a technique for extracting the opinions from the online user reviews. Initially the data extracted from the web document which is unstructured. This phase is used for formatting the data before sentiment analysis and mining. In the second phase Feature extraction and opinion extraction is done. The features like term frequency, Part of Speech (POS) are extracted from the words in the documents. After feature extraction, we extract useful information to rate them as positive, neutral, or negative. The positive and negative features are identified by extracting the associated modifiers and opinions. Finally the supervised learning algorithm decision tree classifier is implemented with the help of features extracted. In the final step ranking and classification will be done.

In this paper we aim to summarize the customer reviews in factual form as done using two statistical techniques that Bayesian statistics and frequency distribution. The proposed system reads the reviews word by word and finally it finds out the summarized result in terms of frequency and probability of opinions. Bayesian probability is the most current and useful for accurate results and true predictions. Frequency results are in graphical form, the use by a new customer can easily decision to buy the product displayed. Frequency based results can be easily understood by all consumer and the results of Bayesian probability are used to verify the results of frequency.

However, Twitter users express sentiment towards a large variety of products in many different languages. Besides, sentiment expressed on Twitter is more up to date and represents the sentiment of a larger population than review articles. Therefore, we propose a method that identifies product features using review articles and then conduct sentiment analysis on tweets containing those features. In that way, we can increase the precision of feature extraction by up to 40% compared to features extracted directly from tweets. Moreover, our method translates and matches the features extracted for multiple languages and ranks them based on how frequently the features are mentioned in the tweets of each language.

1186;FEATURE EXTRACTION AND OPINION MINING IN ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Aravindan, S. and Ekbal, A.;2014;In this era of web applications, web shopping portals have become increasingly popular as they allow customers to buy products from home. These websites often request the customers to rate their products and write reviews, which helps the manufacturers to improve the quality of their products and other customers in choosing the right product or service. The rapid increase in the popularity of e-commerce has increased the number of customers in these type of web-shopping portals, leading to an enormous number of reviews for each product or service. Each of these reviews may describe the different features of the products. Hence, the customer has to go through a large number of reviews before s/he can arrive to a fully informed decision on whether to buy the product or not. In this paper, we describe a system, which automatically extracts the product features from the reviews and determines if they have been expressed in a positive or a negative way by the reviewers. The proposed algorithm works in two steps, viz feature extraction and polarity classification. We use association rule mining to identify the most characteristic features of a product. In the second step we develop a supervised machine learning algorithm based polarity classifier that determines the sentiment of the review sentences with respect to the prominent features. Our experiments on the benchmark reviews of five popular products show that our classifier is highly efficient and achieves an accuracy of 79.67%. We did not make use of any domain specific resources and tools, and thus our classifier is domain-independent, and can be used for the similar tasks in other domains.;Information Technology (ICIT), 2014 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;94-99;10.1109/ICIT.2014.72;NULO;Incluir

Extracting features from unstructured text and assign for each feature its associated sentiment in a clear and efficient way is the goal of this paper. Aspect or feature sentiment analysis is the suitable level of sentiment classification especially for dealing with the domain of products and their related features. We introduce two important and text-related techniques for this purpose namely sentiment classification and semantic Web technology. Sentiment analysis extracts people's opinions in an automatic manner, while semantic Web technology provides a useful improvement by enriching data with additional meaning (semantically annotated) and makes product features better understood by human and automatically processed by machines. For evaluation, we apply our sentiment analysis method twice. Once on a plain corpus, and once again on the same corpus after applying semantic annotation to its data. We also compute the precision and recall principles to evaluate our information extraction method over the corpus in its both cases.;Business Information Systems Workshops, Bis 2013;Book Section;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000340569100025;160;270-277;NULO;1865-1348978-3-642-41686-6/ 978-3-642-41687-3;Incluir

1190;FEATURE SELECTION FOR ORDINAL REGRESSION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Baccianella, S. and Esuli, A. and Sebastiani, F.;2010;Ordinal regression (also known as ordinal classification) is a supervised learning task that consists of automatically determining the implied rating of a data item on a fixed, discrete rating scale. This problem is receiving increasing attention from the sentiment analysis and opinion mining community, due to the importance of automatically rating increasing amounts of product review data in digital form. As in other supervised learning tasks such as (binary or multiclass) classification, feature selection is needed in order to improve efficiency and to avoid overfitting. However, while feature selection has been extensively studied for other classification tasks, is has not for ordinal regression. In this paper we present four novel feature selection metrics that we have specifically devised for ordinal regression, and test them on two datasets of product review data.

1191;FEATURE SELECTION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON CONTENT AND SYNTAX MODELS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Duric, A. and Song, F.;2012;Recent solutions for sentiment analysis have relied on feature selection methods ranging from lexicon-based approaches where the set of features are generated by humans, to approaches that use general statistical measures where features are selected solely on empirical evidence. The advantage of statistical approaches is that they are fully automatic, however, they often fail to separate features that carry sentiment from those that do not. In this paper we propose a set of new feature selection schemes that use a Content and Syntax model to automatically learn a set of features in a review document by separating the entities that are being reviewed from the subjective expressions that describe those entities in terms of polarities. By focusing only on the subjective expressions and ignoring the entities, we can choose more salient features for document-level sentiment analysis. The results obtained from using these features in a maximum entropy classifier are competitive with the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

1193;FEATURE SELECTION METHODS IN PERSIAN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Saraee, M.a  and Bagheri, A.b;2013;With the enormous growth of digital content in internet, various types of online reviews such as product and movie reviews present a wealth of subjective information that can be very helpful for potential users. Sentiment analysis aims to use automated tools to detect subjective information from reviews. Up to now as there are few researches conducted on feature selection in sentiment analysis, there are very rare works for Persian sentiment analysis. This paper considers the problem of sentiment classification using different feature selection methods for online customer reviews in Persian language. Three of the challenges of Persian text are using of a wide variety of declensional suffixes, different word spacing and many informal or colloquial words. In this paper we study these challenges by proposing a model for sentiment classification of Persian review documents. The proposed model is based on stemming and feature selection and is employed Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. We evaluate the performance of the model on a collection of cellphone reviews, where the results show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

1194;FEATURE SUBSUMPTION FOR OPINION ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Riloff, E.a  and Patwardhan, S.a  and Wiebe, J.b;2006;Lexical features are key to many approaches to sentiment analysis and opinion detection. A variety of representations have been used, including single words, multi-word Ngrams, phrases, and lexicosyntactic patterns. In this paper, we use a subsumption hierarchy to formally define different types of lexical features and their relationship to one another, both in terms of representational coverage and performance. We use the subsumption hierarchy in two ways: (1) as an analytic tool to automatically identify complex features that outperform simpler features, and (2) to reduce a feature set by removing unnecessary features. We show that reducing the feature set improves performance on three opinion classification tasks, especially when combined with traditional feature selection.

1195;FEATURE-AWARE REGULARIZATION FOR SPARSE ONLINE LEARNING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Oiwa, H.a  and Matsushima, S.a  and Nakagawa, H.a  b;2014;Learning a compact predictive model in an online setting has recently gained a great deal of attention. The combination of online learning with sparsity-inducing regularization enables faster learning with a smaller memory space than the previous learning frameworks. Many optimization methods and learning algorithms have been developed on the basis of online learning with L 1-regularization. L 1-regularization tends to truncate some types of parameters, such as those that rarely occur or have a small range of values, unless they are emphasized in advance. However, the inclusion of a pre-processing step would make it very difficult to preserve the advantages of online learning. We propose a new regularization framework for sparse online learning. We focus on regularization terms, and we enhance the state-of-the-art regularization approach by integrating information on all previous subgradients of the loss function into a regularization term. The resulting algorithms enable online learning to adjust the intensity of each features truncations without pre-processing and eventually eliminate the bias of L 1-regularization. We show theoretical properties of our framework, the computational complexity and upper bound of regret. Experiments demonstrated that our algorithms outperformed previous methods in many classification tasks.

1197;FEATURE-BASED OPINION MINING AND RANKING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Eirinaki, M. and Pisal, S. and Singh, J.;2012;The proliferation of blogs and social networks presents a new set of challenges and opportunities in the way information is searched and retrieved. Even though facts still play a very important role when information is sought on a topic, opinions have become increasingly important as well. Opinions expressed in blogs and social networks are playing an important role influencing everything from the products people buy to the presidential candidate they support. Thus, there is a need for a new type of search engine which will not only retrieve facts, but will also enable the retrieval of opinions. Such a search engine can be used in a number of diverse applications like product reviews to aggregating opinions on a political candidate or issue. Enterprises can also use such an engine to determine how users perceive their products and how they stand with respect to competition. This paper presents an algorithm which not only analyzes the overall sentiment of a document/review, but also identifies the semantic orientation of specific components of the review that lead to a particular sentiment. The algorithm is integrated in an opinion search engine which presents results to a query along with their overall tone and a summary of sentiments of the most important features.

While users were merely information consumers in the traditional Web, they play a much more active role in the Social Web since they are now also data providers. The mass involved in the process of creating Web content has led many public and private organizations to focus their attention on analyzing this content in order to ascertain the general publicâ€™s opinions as regards a number of topics. Given the current Web size and growth rate, automated techniques are essential if practical and scalable solutions are to be obtained. Opinion mining is a highly active research field that comprises natural language processing, computational linguistics and text analysis techniques with the aim of extracting various kinds of added-value and informational elements from usersâ€™ opinions. However, current opinion mining approaches are hampered by a number of drawbacks such as the absence of semantic relations between concepts in feature search processes or the lack of advanced mathematical methods in sentiment analysis processes. In this paper we propose an innovative opinion mining methodology that takes advantage of new Semantic Web-guided solutions to enhance the results obtained with traditional natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis processes. The main goals of the proposed methodology are: (1) to improve feature-based opinion mining by using ontologies at the feature selection stage, and (2) to provide a new vector analysis-based method for sentiment analysis. The methodology has been implemented and thoroughly tested in a real-world movie review-themed scenario, yielding very promising results when compared with other conventional approaches.;Expert Systems with Applications;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417414001511;41;5995 - 6008;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.03.022;0957-4174;Incluir

But traditional sentiment analysis models have been lacking in concern on the modifying relationship between words for sentiment analysis of Chinese reviews, and limit the development of opinion mining. This paper proposes a feature-based vector model and a novel weighting algorithm for sentiment analysis of Chinese product reviews. It considers both modifying relationships between words and punctuations in review texts. Specifically, it can classify reviews into two categories, i.e., positive and negative, and can also represent the sentiment strength by adverb of degree. Moreover, a novel feature extraction method based on dependency parsing is presented to identify the corresponding aspects that opinions words modify. We conduct some experiments to evaluate our algorithms, and demonstrate that the proposed approaches are efficient and promising.

1201;FEROM: FEATURE EXTRACTION AND REFINEMENT FOR OPINION MINING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Jeong, H.a  and Shin, D.b  and Choi, J.b;2011;Opinion mining involves the analysis of customer opinions using product reviews and provides meaningful information including the polarity of the opinions. In opinion mining, feature extraction is important since the customers do not normally express their product opinions holistically but separately according to its individual features. However, previous research on feature-based opinion mining has not had good results due to drawbacks, such as selecting a feature considering only syntactical grammar information or treating features with similar meanings as different. To solve these problems, this paperproposes an enhanced feature extraction and refinement method called FEROM that effectively extracts correct features from review data by exploiting both grammatical properties and semantic characteristics of feature words and refines the features by recognizing and merging similar ones. A series of experiments performed on actual online review data demonstrated that FEROM is highly effective at extracting and refining features for analyzing customer review data and eventually contributes to accurate and functional opinion mining.

Much of the research in this field focuses on explicit feature extraction and sentiment extraction. However, implicit feature extraction is a relatively new research field. Whereas previous works focused on finding the correct implicit feature in a sentence, given the fact that one is known to be present, this research aims at finding the right implicit feature without this pre-knowledge. Potential implicit features are assigned a score based on their co-occurrence frequencies with the words of a sentence, with the highest-scoring one being assigned to that sentence. To distinguish between sentences that have an implicit feature and the ones that do not, a threshold parameter is introduced, filtering out potential features whose score is too low. Using restaurant reviews and product reviews, the threshold-based approach improves the F1-measure by 3.6 and 8.7 percentage points, respectively.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Article;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84921729929&partnerID=40&md5=b100d6759f39d3df7d90e6fc58cf1d30;8541;130-144;NULO;NULO;Incluir

1204;FINE-GRAINED OPINION MINING USING CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Shariaty, S. and Moghaddam, S.;2011;User generated data and specially product reviews are major sources of information for costumers to make informed purchase decisions and for producers to keep track of consumers opinions. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that each product receives grows rapidly. As a result, the problem of automatically mining reviews to extract useful information has recently attracted many researchers. In the last decade, several works have been presented for identifying product aspects from reviews. Product aspects are components or attributes of the product that have been commented on in the review, e.g. zoom and battery life for a digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel method for mining user opinions, which aims at extracting not only the opinions of users on product aspects, but also a finer level of information indicating the usage type of the aspect. In other words, we try to find out how the reviewer used the aspect. In this work, we focus on the task of identifying product aspects, corresponding opinions, and related usages as a sequence tagging problem. We employ Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to solve the stated problem and propose techniques for defining and filtering features to enhance the accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using a real life data set from Epinions.com. Experimental evaluation confirms the improved accuracy of our method in identifying aspects, aspect usages, and related opinions. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization techniques through multiple experiments.;Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;109-114;10.1109/ICDMW.2011.85;NULO;Incluir
1205;FINE-GRAINED PRODUCT FEATURES EXTRACTION AND CATEGORIZATION IN REVIEWS OPINION MINING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Huang, S. and Liu, X. and Peng, X. and Niu, Z.;2012;With the growth of user-generated contents on the Web, product reviews opinion mining increasingly becomes a research practice of great value to e-commerce, search and recommendation. Unfortunately, the number of reviews is rising up to hundreds or even thousands, especially for some popular items, which makes it a laborious work for the potential buyers and the manufacturers to read through them to make a wise decision. Besides, the free format and the uncertainty of reviews expressions, make fine-grained product features extraction and categorization a more difficult task than traditional information extraction techniques. In this work, we propose to treat product feature extraction as a sequence labeling task and employ a discriminative learning model using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to tackle it. We innovatively incorporate the part-of-speech features and the sentence structure features into the CRFs learning process. For product feature categorization, we introduce the semantic knowledge-based and distributional context-based similarity measures to calculate the similarities between product feature expressions, then an effective graph pruning based categorizing algorithm is proposed to classify the collection of feature expressions into different semantic groups. The empirical studies have proved the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches compared with other counterpart methods.

1206;FLAME: A PROBABILISTIC MODEL COMBINING ASPECT BASED OPINION MINING AND COLLABORATIVE FILTERING;ACM;ACM;Wu, Yao and Ester, Martin;2015;Aspect-based opinion mining from online reviews has attracted a lot of attention recently. Given a set of reviews, the main task of aspect-based opinion mining is to extract major aspects of the items and to infer the latent aspect ratings from each review. However, users may have different preferences which might lead to different opinions on the same aspect of an item. Even if fine-grained aspect rating analysis is provided for each review, it is still difficult for a user to judge whether a specific aspect of an item meets his own expectation. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating personalized sentiment polarities on different aspects of the items. We propose a unified probabilistic model called Factorized Latent Aspect ModEl (FLAME), which combines the advantages of collaborative filtering and aspect based opinion mining. FLAME learns users personalized preferences on different aspects from their past reviews, and predicts users aspect ratings on new items by collective intelligence. Experiments on two online review datasets show that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the tasks of aspect identification and aspect rating prediction.;Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining;NULO;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2684822.2685291;NULO;199--208;10.1145/2684822.2685291;978-1-4503-3317-7;Incluir

To mine the overall sentiment or opinion polarity, sentiment analysis can be used to mine the overall sentiment or opinion polarity of the review. The objective of this paper is to extract features from the product reviews and classify reviews into positive, negative and neutral. Feature based sentiment classification approach is used to extract sentiments. It involves preprocessing to remove noise, extraction of features and corresponding descriptors and tagging their polarity. The proposed technique extends the feature based classification approach to incorporate the effect of various linguistic hedges.

Measuring the frequency of certain terms to determine the popularity of a topic is comparably straightforward. Detecting sentiment expressed in user-generated electronic content is more challenging, especially in the case of digital ecosystems comprising heterogeneous sets of multilingual documents. This paper describes the use of language-specific grammar patterns and multilingual tagged dictionaries to detect sentiment in German and English document repositories. Digital ecosystems may contain millions of frequently updated documents, requiring sentiment detection methods that maximize throughput. The ideal combination of high-throughput techniques and more accurate (but slower) approaches depends on the specific requirements of an application.

Understanding the emotional impacts of participation on patients and their informal caregivers is important for OHC managers. Ethnographical observations, interviews, and questionnaires have reported benefits from online health communities, but these approaches are too costly to adopt for large-scale analyses of emotional impacts. A computational approach using machine learning and text mining techniques is demonstrated using data from the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online forum of nearly a half million posts. This approach automatically estimates the sentiment of forum posts, discovers sentiment change patterns in CSN members, and allows investigation of factors that affect the sentiment change. This first study of sentiment benefits and dynamics in a large-scale health-related electronic community finds that an estimated 75%-85% of CSN forum participants change their sentiment in a positive direction through online interactions with other community members. Two new features, Name and Slang, not previously used in sentiment analysis, facilitate identifying positive sentiment in posts.

1215;HOTELOPINION: AN OPINION MINING SYSTEM ON HOTEL REVIEWS IN THAILAND;IEEE_A;IEEE;Kongthon, A. and Haruechaiyasak, C. and Sangkeettrakarn, C. and Palingoon, P. and Wunnasri, W.;2011;This paper reports on the extension of our previous work on feature-based opinion mining for Thai language. In this paper, we present an approach for automatically constructing two main lexicons: features and polar words based on syntactic pattern analysis. The evaluation is performed with a case study on hotel reviews. The experimental results show that our approach is effective in performing its task. To illustrate the potential application, we implement a system called HotelOpinion for summarizing the hotel reviews written in the Thai language. Our system can also generate a comparison between hotels based upon the user's preferred features and then present the results in a user-friendly visualization. Results from our system can be used to determine public perceptions regarding selected hotels in order to allow the business to improve their customer intimacy and satisfaction.;Technology Management in the Energy Smart World (PICMET), 2011 Proceedings of PICMET 11:;NULO;NULO;NULO;1-6;NULO;NULO;Excluir
1216;HOW DO USERS LIKE THIS FEATURE? A FINE GRAINED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF APP REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Guzman, E. and Maalej, W.;2014;App stores allow users to submit feedback for downloaded apps in form of star ratings and text reviews. Recent studies analyzed this feedback and found that it includes information useful for app developers, such as user requirements, ideas for improvements, user sentiments about specific features, and descriptions of experiences with these features. However, for many apps, the amount of reviews is too large to be processed manually and their quality varies largely. The star ratings are given to the whole app and developers do not have a mean to analyze the feedback for the single features. In this paper we propose an automated approach that helps developers filter, aggregate, and analyze user reviews. We use natural language processing techniques to identify fine-grained app features in the reviews. We then extract the user sentiments about the identified features and give them a general score across all reviews. Finally, we use topic modeling techniques to group fine-grained features into more meaningful high-level features. We evaluated our approach with 7 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and compared its results with a manually, peer-conducted analysis of the reviews. On average, our approach has a precision of 0.59 and a recall of 0.51. The extracted features were coherent and relevant to requirements evolution tasks. Our approach can help app developers to systematically analyze user opinions about single features and filter irrelevant reviews.;Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), 2014 IEEE 22nd International;NULO;NULO;NULO;153-162;10.1109/RE.2014.6912257;NULO;Incluir
1217;HOW IS A SERVICE BASED ON SERVICE-DOMINANT DESIGN SUPERIOR TO GOODS-DOMINANT DESIGN?;IEEE_B;IEEE;Edvardsson, B. and Ng, G. and Choo Zhi Min and Firth, R. and Ding Yi;2011;Research suggests that service-dominant designs are superior to goods-dominant, but why? Few empirical studies have been conducted to explore the mechanisms and drivers of service exchange and value co-creation resulting in favorable customer experiences. This paper attempts to bridge that knowledge gap. Our aim is to answer two questions: (1) How is a service based on service-dominant logic (SDL) superior to one based on goods-dominant logic (GDL)? (2) Which aspects of the service system facilitate the co-creation of value-in-context as perceived by the customer? An experiment was carried out with a group of habitual bus travelers to plan a specific journey using two online journey planning systems, one representing a GDL informed service and the other SDL. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered regarding the subjects perceived experiences with the two systems. The SDL informed service system offers a better experience due largely a consequence of three key differentiators. Our principal findings thus help to establish the empirical foundation for SDL and to identify the characteristics and behaviors that set the SDL-based service system apart from the GDL-based system.;Service Sciences (IJCSS), 2011 International Joint Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;282-286;10.1109/IJCSS.2011.63;NULO;Excluir

VelÃ¡squez and Felipe Bravo-Marquez and Yutaka Matsuo;2013;Abstract In this study we extend Bing Lius aspect-based opinion mining technique to apply it to the tourism domain. Using this extension, we also offer an approach for considering a new alternative to discover consumer preferences about tourism products, particularly hotels and restaurants, using opinions available on the Web as reviews. An experiment is also conducted, using hotel and restaurant reviews obtained from TripAdvisor, to evaluate our proposals. Results showed that tourism product reviews available on web sites contain valuable information about customer preferences that can be extracted using an aspect-based opinion mining approach. The proposed approach proved to be very effective in determining the sentiment orientation of opinions, achieving a precision and recall of 90%. However, on average, the algorithms were only capable of extracting 35% of the explicit aspect expressions.;Procedia Computer Science;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050913008879;22;182 - 191;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2013.09.094;1877-0509;Incluir

For this, a well performing feature extraction method is needed. In this paper we focus on detecting explicit features. For this purpose, we use grammatical relations between words in combination with baseline statistics of words as found in the review text.

1220;IDENTIFYING FEATURES IN OPINION MINING VIA INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC DOMAIN RELEVANCE;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Hai, Z.a  and Chang, K.a  and Kim, J.-J.a  and Yang, C.C.b;2014;The vast majority of existing approaches to opinion feature extraction rely on mining patterns only from a single review corpus, ignoring the nontrivial disparities in word distributional characteristics of opinion features across different corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify opinion features from online reviews by exploiting the difference in opinion feature statistics across two corpora, one domain-specific corpus (i.e., the given review corpus) and one domain-independent corpus (i.e., the contrasting corpus). We capture this disparity via a measure called domain relevance (DR), which characterizes the relevance of a term to a text collection. We first extract a list of candidate opinion features from the domain review corpus by defining a set of syntactic dependence rules. For each extracted candidate feature, we then estimate its intrinsic-domain relevance (IDR) and extrinsic-domain relevance (EDR) scores on the domain-dependent and domain-independent corpora, respectively. Candidate features that are less generic (EDR score less than a threshold) and more domain-specific (IDR score greater than another threshold) are then confirmed as opinion features. We call this interval thresholding approach the intrinsic and extrinsic domain relevance (IEDR) criterion. Experimental results on two real-world review domains show the proposed IEDR approach to outperform several other well-established methods in identifying opinion features.

1221;IDENTIFYING NOUN PRODUCT FEATURES THAT IMPLY OPINIONS;ACM;ACM;Zhang, Lei and Liu, Bing;2011;Identifying domain-dependent opinion words is a key problem in opinion mining and has been studied by several researchers. However, existing work has been focused on adjectives and to some extent verbs. Limited work has been done on nouns and noun phrases. In our work, we used the feature-based opinion mining model, and we found that in some domains nouns and noun phrases that indicate product features may also imply opinions. In many such cases, these nouns are not subjective but objective. Their involved sentences are also objective sentences and imply positive or negative opinions. Identifying such nouns and noun phrases and their polarities is very challenging but critical for effective opinion mining in these domains. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in the literature. This paper proposes a method to deal with the problem. Experimental results based on real-life datasets show promising results.;Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies: Short Papers - Volume 2;NULO;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2002736.2002849;NULO;575--580;NULO;978-1-932432-88-6;Incluir
1222;IDENTIFYING PRODUCT FEATURES FROM CUSTOMER REVIEWS USING LEXICAL CONCORDANCE;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Khan, K. and Baharudin, B.B.;2012;Automatic extraction of features from unstructured text is one of the challenging problems of Opinion Mining. The trend of getting products and services reputation from online resources such as web blogs and customer feedback is increasing day by day. Therefore efficient system is required to automatically extract products features and the opinion of consumers about all aspects of the products. In this study our focus is on extraction of product features from customer reviews. We have proposed a concordance based technique for automatic extraction of features of product from customer reviews. In our proposed technique we extract patterns of lexical terms using concordance for candidate features extraction and identify features by grouping. The proposed grouping algorithm is used to remove irrelevant features. We conducted experiments on different products reviews and compared our results with existing methods. From empirical results we proved the validity of the proposed method.

Opinion mining processing that uses Natural Language Processing approach is difficult due to the high content of noisy texts in online messages. On the other hand, opinion mining that uses machine learning approach requires a good feature selection technique since the current filter typed feature selection techniques require interference from the user to select the appropriate features. This study used a feature selection technique based on artificial immune system to select the appropriated features for opinion mining.

Adding images to documents, websites, magazines, helps attracting the attention and providing an immediate feeling about the content of the document itself. At the same time, images can be used to influence the attitude of the reader. In the digital era it is easier than ever to create and share multimedia documents making extensive use of visual data. Furthermore, it is extremely easy to modify and adapt the images in order to make them more suitable to convey a concept. These modifications may simply consist in focusing the attention on a specific part of the image, to heavier manipulations such as changing the visual appearance or the contents to bias the opinion of the observer. This creates a rising interest for the availability of automatic blind tools able to detect possible modifications of images, and to correlate these modifications with the relevant impact on the viewer. This paper proposes an example of application of these concepts that exploits a tool for automatic detection of contrast modifications and analyzes their impact on human feeling.

1227;IMPLICIT FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN CONSUMER REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Schouten, K. and Frasincar, F.;2014;With the increasing popularity of aspect-level sentiment analysis, where sentiment is attributed to the actual aspects, or features, on which it is uttered, much attention is given to the problem of detecting these features. While most aspects appear as literal words, some are instead implied by the choice of words. With research in aspect detection advancing, we shift our focus to the less researched group of implicit features. By leveraging the co-occurrence between a set of known implicit features and notional words, we are able to predict the implicit feature based on the choice of words in a sentence. Using two different types of consumer reviews (product reviews and restaurant reviews), an F1-measure of 38% and 64% is obtained on these data sets, respectively.

1228;IMPLICIT FEATURE IDENTIFICATION IN CHINESE REVIEWS USING EXPLICIT TOPIC MINING MODEL;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Xu, H. and Zhang, F. and Wang, W.;2015;The essential work of feature-specific opinion mining is centered on the product features. Previous related research work has often taken into account explicit features but ignored implicit features, However, implicit feature identification, which can help us better understand the reviews, is an essential aspect of feature-specific opinion mining. This paper is mainly centered on implicit feature identification in Chinese product reviews. We think that based on the explicit synonymous feature group and the sentences which contain explicit features, several Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers can be established to classify the non-explicit sentences. Nevertheless, instead of simply using traditional feature selection methods, we believe an explicit topic model in which each topic is pre-defined could perform better. In this paper, we first extend a popular topic modeling method, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to construct an explicit topic model. Then some types of prior knowledge, such as: must-links, cannot-links and relevance-based prior knowledge, are extracted and incorporated into the explicit topic model automatically. Experiments show that the explicit topic model, which incorporates pre-existing knowledge, outperforms traditional feature selection methods and other existing methods by a large margin and the identification task can be completed better.;Knowledge-Based Systems;Article;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84923080938&partnerID=40&md5=9bbe8e251dac9db0c7a3fdfdbed7644c;76;166-175;10.1016/j.knosys.2014.12.012;NULO;Excluir

However, most of the traditional opinion mining methods are coarse-grained and cannot understand natural languages. Thus, aspect-based opinion mining and summarization are of great interest in academic and industrial research. In this paper, we study an approach to extract product and service aspect words, as well as sentiment words, automatically from reviews. An unsupervised dependency analysis-based approach is presented to extract Appraisal Expression Patterns (AEPs) from reviews, which represent the manner in which people express opinions regarding products or services and can be regarded as a condensed representation of the syntactic relationship between aspect and sentiment words. \{AEPs\} are high-level, domain-independent types of information, and have excellent domain adaptability. An AEP-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (AEP-LDA) model is also proposed. This is a sentence-level, probabilistic generative model which assumes that all words in a sentence are drawn from one topic â€ a generally true assumption, based on our observation. The model also assumes that every review corpus is composed of several mutually corresponding aspect and sentiment topics, as well as a background word topic. The \{AEP\} information is incorporated into the AEP-LDA model for mining aspect and sentiment words simultaneously. The experimental results on reviews of restaurants, hotels, \{MP3\} players, and cameras show that the AEP-LDA model outperforms other approaches in identifying aspect and sentiment words.;Knowledge-Based Systems;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705114000434;61;29 - 47;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2014.02.003;0950-7051;Incluir

The lexical base, on the other hand, targets for particular characteristics of a given domain and acts as a plug-in part in our prototype system, thus does not affect the portability when applying the proposed approach in practice.

1236;INFLUENCE FACTOR BASED OPINION MINING OF TWITTER DATA USING SUPERVISED LEARNING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Anjaria, M. and Guddeti, R.M.R.;2014;Social Networking portals have been widely used for expressing opinions in the public domain through internet based text messages and images. Among popular social networking portals, Twitter has been the point of attraction to several researchers in important areas like prediction of democratic electoral events, consumer brands, movie box office, stock market, popularity of celebrities etc. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers a fast and efficient way of monitoring the public sentiment. In this paper, we introduce the novel approach of exploiting the user influence factor in order to predict the outcome of an election result. We also propose a hybrid approach of extracting opinion using direct and indirect features of Twitter data based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Artificial Neural Networks based supervised classifiers. We combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with SVM in an attempt to perform dimensionality reduction. This paper shows two different case studies of entirely different social scenarios, US Presidential Elections 2012 and Karnataka Assembly Elections 2013. We conclude the conditions under which Twitter may fail or succeed in predicting the outcome of elections.

1237;INTEGRATING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND TERM ASSOCIATIONS WITH GEO-TEMPORAL VISUALIZATIONS ON CUSTOMER FEEDBACK STREAMS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Hao, M.a  and Rohrdantz, C.b  and Janetzko, H.b  and Keim, D.b  and Dayal, U.a  and Haug, L.-E.a  and Hsu, M.-C.a;2012;Twitter currently receives over 190 million tweets (small text-based Web posts) and manufacturing companies receive over 10 thousand web product surveys a day, in which people share their thoughts regarding a wide range of products and their features. A large number of tweets and customer surveys include opinions about products and services. However, with Twitter being a relatively new phenomenon, these tweets are underutilized as a source for determining customer sentiments. To explore high-volume customer feedback streams, we integrate three time series-based visual analysis techniques: (1) feature-based sentiment analysis that extracts, measures, and maps customer feedback:, (2) a novel idea of term associations that identify attributes, verbs, and adjectives frequently occurring together:, and (3) new pixel cell-based sentiment calendars, geo-temporal map visualizations and self-organizing maps to identify co-occurring and influential opinions. We have combined these techniques into a well-fitted solution for an effective analysis of large customer feedback streams such as for movie reviews (e.g., Kung-Fu Panda) or web surveys (buyers).

1238;INTEGRATION OF OPINION INTO CUSTOMER ANALYSIS MODEL;IEEE_B;IEEE;Yaakub, M.R. and Yuefeng Li and Yanming Feng;2011;Nowadays, Opinion Mining is getting more important than before especially in doing analysis and forecasting about customers behavior for businesses purpose. The right decision in producing new products or services based on data about customers characteristics means profit for organization/company. This paper proposes a new architecture for Opinion Mining, which uses a multidimensional model to integrate customers characteristics and their comments about products (or services). The key step to achieve this objective is to transfer comments (opinions) to a fact table that includes several dimensions, such as, customers, products, time and locations. This research presents a comprehensive way to calculate customers orientation for all possible products attributes. A use case study is also presented in this paper to show the advantages of using OLAP and data cubes to analyze costumers opinions.;e-Business Engineering (ICEBE), 2011 IEEE 8th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;90-95;10.1109/ICEBE.2011.53;NULO;Excluir
1239;INTERNET PUBLIC OPINION HOTSPOT DETECTION AND ANALYSIS BASED ON KMEANS AND SVM ALGORITHM;IEEE_B;IEEE;Hong Liu;2010;Rapid progress of network arouses much attention on Internet public opinion, it is important to grasp the internet public opinion in time and understand the trends of their opinion correctly. Text mining plays a fundamental role in categorization and monitoring of internet public opinion, but internet public opinion is much more difficult than pure-text process because of their semi-structured characteristic. To address this issue, we propose a model for internet public opinion hotspot detection and analysis. Due to the text format of internet public opinion, we introduce the traditional vector space model (VSM) to express them, and then use Kmeans algorithm to perform text clustering on a corpus collected from some news website, and use SVM classifier to perform text categorization for new text opinion analysis, the result of the experiment shows that the efficiency and effectiveness of such method.;Information Science and Management Engineering (ISME), 2010 International Conference of;NULO;NULO;1;257-261;10.1109/ISME.2010.207;NULO;Excluir

We first use the Active Shape Model (ASM) to extract facial feature points. Next, the shape model points from the ASM are normalized to a standard shape and then submitted to a trained AdaBoost classifier to recognize the sentiment of facial expressions. Three types of sentiment are of primary interest: flattering, neutral and unflattering. Finally, the approach is evaluated by experiments, which indicate that the proposed method is sufficiently effective for facial expression analysis of images of election candidates and thus can be used to gauge the public opinion during the election.;Multimedia and Expo (ICME), 2013 IEEE International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1-6;10.1109/ICME.2013.6607633;1945-7871;Excluir

1245;LANGUAGE FEATURE MINING FOR DOCUMENT SUBJECTIVITY ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Chen, B. and He, H. and Guo, J.;2007;In recent years, document sentiment analysis has attracted a great deal of research interest. One important aspect of this filed is the subjectivity analysis. This problem is different from traditional text categorization on that more linguistic or semantic information are required for better estimating the subjectivity of a document. Therefore, in this paper, focuses are on how to extract useful and meaningful language features and how to combine all of these language features efficiently. Under the well-known ngram language model framework, we investigated a series of language-grams having different n-order and various distances to find the most important ones. In addition, we have also tried several weighting methods to make features more meaningful. Based on various kinds of language features, we adopted a tailored Maximum Entropy modeling method to construct our subjectivity classifier. Detailed experiments given in this paper show that the well extracted language features are suit for the document subjectivity analysis task.

However, typing text query on mobile device and digesting a large number of retrieved user-generated data are both inconvenient for users. To overcome these troubles, we develop a wearable system, Le Festin, which is a shop sign recognition assisted food recommendation system. In Le Festin, food recommendation list and restaurant-related information can be easily obtained by just snapping restaurant signboard. The system is composed of two main techniques: Chinese character recognition (CCR) and blog mining. We integrate a powerful CCR algorithm which has the accuracy about 90% and propose a new blog mining method which is combined with food name extraction and sentiment analysis.

Such consumer reviews are essential and beneficial for customers, merchants, and product manufacturers. However, as the number of consumer reviews expands rapidly, it becomes more difficult for users to obtain a comprehensive view of consumer opinions pertaining to the products of interest through a manual analysis. The development of techniques capable of automatic analysis and summary of the sentiments of consumer reviews pertaining to specific products becomes desirable and essential. In this study, we concentrate on the sentiment classification of consumer reviews. To address the problem of domain dependency commonly encountered by existing techniques, we proposed a gloss-based sentiment classification technique which is domain-independent in nature. According to our empirical evaluation results, the proposed gloss-based sentiment classification technique outperforms the traditional approach.;Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC), 2011 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;2;483-488;10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016772;2160-133X;Excluir

The approach is grounded in insights about how people summarize image collections. We utilize the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform to obtain a large number of manually created visual summaries as well as information about criteria for image inclusion in the summary. Based on these large-scale user tests, we propose an automatic image selection approach, which jointly utilizes the analysis of image content, context, popularity, visual aesthetic appeal as well as the sentiment derived from the comments posted on the images. In our approach we do not describe images based on their properties only, but also in the context of semantically related images, which improves robustness and effectively enables propagation of sentiment, aesthetic appeal as well as various inherent attributes associated with a particular group of images. We discuss the phenomenon of a low inter-user agreement, which makes an automatic evaluation of visual summaries a challenging task and propose a solution inspired by the text summarization and machine translation communities.

1249;LEARNING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC POLARITY LEXICONS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Demiroz, G. and Yanikoglu, B. and Tapucu, D. and Saygin, Y.;2012;Sentiment analysis aims to automatically estimate the sentiment in a given text as positive or negative. Polarity lexicons, often used in sentiment analysis, indicate how positive or negative each term in the lexicon is. However, since creating domain-specific polarity lexicons is expensive and time consuming, researchers often use a general purpose or domain independent lexicon. In this work, we address the problem of adapting a general purpose polarity lexicon to a specific domain and propose a simple yet effective adaptation algorithm. We experimented with two sets of reviews from the hotel and movie domains and observed that while our adaptation techniques changed the polarity values for only a small set of words, the overall test accuracy increased significantly: 77% to 83% in the hotel dataset and 61% to 66% in the movie dataset.;Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;674-679;10.1109/ICDMW.2012.120;NULO;Excluir

1251;LEXICON BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF URDU TEXT USING SENTIUNITS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Syed, A.Z.a  and Aslam, M.a  and Martinez-Enriquez, A.M.b;2010;Like other languages, Urdu websites are becoming more popular, because the people prefer to share opinions and express sentiments in their own language. Sentiment analyzers developed for other well-studied languages, like English, are not workable for Urdu, due to their scriptic, morphological, and grammatical differences. As a result, this language should be studied as an independent problem domain. Our approach towards sentiment analysis is based on the identification and extraction of SentiUnits from the given text, using shallow parsing. SentiUnits are the expressions, which contain the sentiment information in a sentence. We use sentiment-annotated lexicon based approach. Unluckily, for Urdu language no such lexicon exists. So, a major part of this research consists in developing such a lexicon. Hence, this paper is presented as a base line for this colossal and complex task. Our goal is to highlight the linguistic (grammar and morphology) as well as technical aspects of this multidimensional research problem.

1252;LINGUISTIC FEATURES FOR SUBJECTIVITY CLASSIFICATION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Huong Nguyen Thi Xuan and Anh Cuong Le and Le Minh Nguyen;2012;Opinions are subjective expressions that describe peoples viewpoints, perspectives or feelings about entities, events and theirs properties. Detecting subjective expressions is the task of identifying whether a given text is subjective (i.e. an opinion)or objective (i.e. a reports fact). This task is considered as the first problem and it is very important for opinion mining and sentiment analysis which is now attracting many researchers cause its applicable capacity. Improvements in subjectivity classification will positively impact on the performance of a sentiment analysis system. Actually, features play the most important role for getting accurate subjective sentences. In this paper, we will enrich features by using syntactic information of the text. From our observation when investigating opinion evidences in the texts, we will propose syntax-based patterns which are used for extracting rich linguistic features. Combining these new features with conventional features from previous studies, we obtain a high accuracy (about 92.1%) for detecting subjective sentences on the Movie review data.;Asian Language Processing (IALP), 2012 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;17-20;10.1109/IALP.2012.47;NULO;Excluir

This paper investigates technological products reviews mining using the psychological and linguistic features obtained through of text analysis software, LIWC. Furthermore, an analysis of the classification techniques J48, SMO, and Bayes Net has been performed by using WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis). This analysis aims to evaluate the classifying potential of the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) dimensions on written opinions in Spanish.

1254;MAKE IT POSSIBLE: MULTILINGUAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WITHOUT MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zheng Lin and Xiaolong Jin and Xueke Xu and Yuanzhuo Wang and Songbo Tan and Xueqi Cheng;2014;Sentiment analysis is a hard problem, while multilingual sentiment analysis is even harder due to the different expression styles in different languages. Although many methods for multilingual sentiment analysis have been developed in the open literature, most of them suffer from two major problems. The first is their excessive dependence on external tools or resources (e.g., Machine translation systems or bilingual dictionaries), which may not be readily obtained, especially for minority languages, The second is conflictive sentiments, i.e., The sentiment polarity of some parts of a text is inconsistent with its overall sentiment polarity. It is observed that in a product or service review there usually exist a few sentences which play a more important role in determining its sentiment polarity, as compared to others. Therefore, differentiating key sentences from trivial ones may be helpful to improve sentiment analysis. Inspired by this observation in this paper we propose a novel framework to estimate the sentiment polarity of reviews by virtue of opinion lexica and key sentences automatically extracted from unlabelled data. This framework cannot only overcome the problem of excessive dependence on external resources, but also is able to capture the overall sentiment polarity of reviews. Experimental results on realistic review datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective and competitive with the representative baselines.;Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT), 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on;NULO;NULO;2;79-86;10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.83;NULO;Excluir
1255;MEASURING THE INFLUENCE OF MASS MEDIA ON OPINION SEGREGATION THROUGH TWITTER;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;WEB_OF_SCIENCE;ElTayeby, Omar and Molnar, Peter and George, Roy;2014;During the US presidential elections the media played a major role in presenting the candidates vision on several topics. Nevertheless, the diversity of opinions along with the political currents, one might notice segregation in opinions among some topics related to each other or a candidate. In the meanwhile, posting opinions on social media could be represented as a sentiment vector towards multiple issues. This gives us a ripe ground for clustering opinions to view tweets that hold similar opinions. In this paper we investigate the medias influence on segregating opinions by constructing an aspect-based opinion mining framework. Our main task is to detect the segregated groups of opinions by solving the proposed model using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We examined a corpus of tweets collected, which are related to famous political topics. We show interesting observations on the sentiment used for particular topics among the groups of opinions, and conclude the percentages of media influences among the segregated groups of opinions with respect to these topics.

However, not all relevant articles for the query may be interesting to a user. For example, if the article is old or yields little new information, the article would be uninteresting. Relevance scores do not take into account what makes an article interesting, which would vary from user to user. Although methods such as collaborative filtering have been shown to be effective in recommendation systems, in a limited user environment, there are not enough users that would make collaborative filtering effective. A general framework, called iScore, is presented for defining and measuring the --interestingness-- of articles, incorporating user-feedback. iScore addresses the various aspects of what makes an article interesting, such as topic relevance, uniqueness, freshness, source reputation, and writing style. It employs various methods, such as multiple topic tracking, online parameter selection, language models, clustering, sentiment analysis, and phrase extraction to measure these features. Due to varying reasons that users hold about why an article is interesting, an online feature selection method in naÃ¯ve Bayes is also used to improve recommendation results. iScore can outperform traditional IR techniques by as much as 50.7%. iScore and its components are evaluated in the news recommendation task using three datasets from Yahoo!

However, the large number of diverse review sources challenges the individual users and organizations on how to use the opinion information effectively. Therefore, automated opinion mining and summarization techniques have become increasingly important.

Specifically, we treat the problem of product feature and opinion extraction as a sequence labeling task and adopt Conditional Random Fields models to accomplish it. As part of our work, we develop a computational approach to construct domain specific sentiment lexicon by combining semi-structured reviews with general sentiment lexicon, which helps to identify the sentiment orientations of opinions.

1262;MINING PRODUCT FEATURES AND OPINIONS BASED ON PATTERN MATCHING;IEEE_B;IEEE;Yao Pan and Yu Wang;2011;Acquiring available information from product reviews can not only instruct consumers to consume rationally, but also help companies to improve competitiveness and their products quality. A method based on pattern matching for mining features and opinions is proposed in this paper according to the characteristics of Chinese reviews. First, the reviews are segmented into fragments with relatively simple structures, and then different patterns are adopted to match fragments with different structures in order to mine the features and opinions in reviews. Finally a method based on features grouping was used to prune, which can keep both infrequent features and the comprehensiveness of mining results. Experimental results show that the method is effective.;Computer Science and Network Technology (ICCSNT), 2011 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;3;1901-1905;10.1109/ICCSNT.2011.6182341;NULO;Excluir
1263;MINING SEMANTIC ORIENTATION OF MULTIWORD EXPRESSION FROM CHINESE MICROBLOGGING WITH DISCRIMINATIVE LATENT MODEL;IEEE_B;IEEE;Xiao Sun and Chengcheng Li and Chenyi Tang and Ren, F.;2013;Extracting semantic orientation of Multiword Expression, especially some newly generated Multiword Expression from internet, is an important task for sentiment analysis of web texts or other real word text as some Multiword Expressions can express more integrative sentiments than words units. This paper proposes a method contains a novel latent discriminative algorithm, which attempts to attack this problem by integrating discriminative model and latent value model. Although Chinese Multiword Expressions consist of multiple words, the semantic orientation of the Multiword Expression is not just simple integration of orientations of the component words, as some words can invert the affective orientation so the Multiword Expressions can have totally opposite semantic orientation. In order to capture the property of such Multiword Expressions, hidden semi-CRF which includes a latent valuable layer, which can be used to address dual-sequence labeling tasks synchronously, is adopted. The method is tested experimentally by adopting a manually labeled set of positive and negative Multiword Expressions from microblog or other internet resources, and the experiments have shown very promising results, which is comparable to the best value ever reported.;Asian Language Processing (IALP), 2013 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;117-120;10.1109/IALP.2013.41;NULO;Excluir
1264;MINING SEQUENTIAL FEATURES AND OPINION WORDS IN USER GENERATED CONTENTS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Ahmad, T. and Doja, M.N.;2011;With the exponential growth of the Web, there has been an exponential growth in user generated contents which is primarily in the form of unstructured or semi structured form. Distillation of knowledge from it becomes a challenging task as the amount of data is very large and contains many unimportant opinions which are not related to the product. In this paper, we propose the design of an opinion mining method which first mines product features, opinions and their semantic orientation from user-generated contents. Thereafter, we apply sequence mining technique to identify the sequence of features that are mostly commented by the users in an order. This helps to identify important features of the products whose badness or goodness can affect the other features. The polarity of extracted opinions and thereby opinion sentences is established using numeric score values obtained through Senti-WordNet. The efficacy of the system is established through experimentation over customer reviews on four different models of digital camera.;Proceedings of the 5th Indian International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IICAI 2011;Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84872195279&partnerID=40&md5=333989868bda85b62a5a2a3042fb8b42;NULO;1113-1124;NULO;NULO;Incluir
1265;MINING THE PEANUT GALLERY: OPINION EXTRACTION AND SEMANTIC CLASSIFICATION OF PRODUCT REVIEWS;ACM;ACM;Dave, Kushal and Lawrence, Steve and Pennock, David M.;2003;The web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them is a daunting task. Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.;Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on World Wide Web;NULO;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/775152.775226;NULO;519--528;10.1145/775152.775226;1-58113-680-3;Excluir
1266;MOBILE APP CONNECTING PEOPLE BASED ON PERSONALITY DETECTION AND IMAGE PERCEPTION ANALYSIS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Ruichi Yu and Shuguan Yang and Guifan Li and Chao Qian and Sambit Sahu and Ching-Yung Lin;2014;We propose a personality detection algorithm based on human perceptions of images and created a mobile social application named Date gram to test the efficiency of our algorithm and connect people who share similar image perceptions. We detect users Big Five personality based on their perceptual opinions on several images. Users in Date gram are matched to play visual-sentiment games, through which their connections based on personality similarity are further strengthened. Datagram utilizes techniques of image sentiment detection to analyze users personality. Given the collected personal sentiment perception data, we proposed personality-mapping algorithm to categorize users into --Big Five-- personality. After the Adjective-Noun-Pairs (ANPs) are extracted from each image, a personalized image-profile that consists of multiple pairs of ANPs and corresponding user decisions is generated. This profile is treated as the input of our algorithm, and a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is applied to extract personality-related features. --Big Five-- personality values are calculated by a word-personality mapping algorithm where the technique of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is used. To evaluate our proposed algorithm, we did user studies over visual sentiments as well as personality detections. The results demonstrate that sentimental opinions from different persons vary significantly towards the same image, people would prefer to connect with those sharing similar perceptions of images and similar personalities with them.;Multimedia (ISM), 2014 IEEE International Symposium on;NULO;NULO;NULO;333-340;10.1109/ISM.2014.73;NULO;Excluir

For the purpose of negation scope detection, we compare 2 methods: the simpler regular expression-based NegEx, and the more sophisticated Conditional Random Field-based LingScope. Additionally, we capture negation implicitly via word bi- and trigrams. We analyze the impact of explicit and implicit negation modeling as well as their combination on several data-driven machine learning-based sentiment analysis subtasks, i.e. document-level polarity classification, both in- and cross-domain, and sentence-level polarity classification.

Morphemes as smallest linguistic meaningful unit are induced in measuring the intra relationship among product features instead of words. Opinion words around product features are chosen to represent the inter relationship among product features instead of full context information. The information gotten from active product features are utilized as constraints to enhance the whole categorization quality. Experimental results show that morpheme has greater linguistic significance than word in Chinese reviews. The opinion words are very important features in measuring the semantic similarity of their associated product features.

1269;MULTI-ASPECT AND MULTI-CLASS BASED DOCUMENT SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF EDUCATIONAL DATA CATERING ACCREDITATION PROCESS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Valakunde, N.D. and Patwardhan, M.S.;2013;Sentiment analysis is used to determine the attitude of a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. Current techniques of sentiment analysis work either at a document or at a sentence or at an entity level. The objective of this research is to compute the document level sentiment analysis score based upon underlying entity or aspect based scores, and their importance towards the evaluation of the topic discussed in the complete document. In this approach we have classified the document into multiple classes with multiple aspects are taken into consideration. The approach allows us to automatically take care of the current problems of document level sentiment analysis, such as, entity identification, subjectivity detection and negation. The technique is further applied for educational data mining, where a faculty performance is evaluated using the sentiment analysis of comments provided by students as a part of their feedback. The document level faculty performance score is computed from the distinct aspect based sentiment scores, such as, knowledge, presentation, communication and regularity of the faculty. The importance of these aspects towards computation of document level score is taken based upon the weight ages. These aspects have, taken up from the NAAC accreditation criteria. The results show that this strategy provides more accurate document level sentiment scores than the scores computed directly at the document level without analyzing the underlying aspects.;Cloud Ubiquitous Computing Emerging Technologies (CUBE), 2013 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;188-192;10.1109/CUBE.2013.42;NULO;Excluir

Sentiment analysis brings together various research areas such as natural language processing, data mining and text mining, and is fast becoming of major importance to organizations as they integrate online commerce into their operations. This paper proposes improved methods for aspect-level sentiment analysis. We propose to utilize bag of nouns instead of bog of words to improve the clustering results for aspect identification and a new feature set, score representation, that leads to more accurate sentiment identification. This scheme is based upon the three scores (positive ness, neutral ness and negative ness) that are learned from the data for each term. Using this new score representation scheme, we improve the performance of 3-class sentiment analysis on sentences by 20% in terms of f1-measure, as compared to previously published research.

1272;MULTI-FACET RATING OF PRODUCT REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Baccianella, S. and Esuli, A. and Sebastiani, F.;2009;Online product reviews are becoming increasingly available, and are being used more and more frequently by consumers in order to choose among competing products. Tools that rank competing products in terms of the satisfaction of consumers that have purchased the product before, are thus also becoming popular. We tackle the problem of rating (i.e., attributing a numerical score of satisfaction to) consumer reviews based on their textual content. We here focus on multi-facet review rating, i.e., on the case in which the review of a product (e.g., a hotel) must be rated several times, according to several aspects of the product (for a hotel: cleanliness, centrality of location, etc.). We explore several aspects of the problem, with special emphasis on how to generate vectorial representations of the text by means of POS tagging, sentiment analysis, and feature selection for ordinal regression learning. We present the results of experiments conducted on a dataset of more than 15,000 reviews that we have crawled from a popular hotel review site.

1273;MULTI-GRANULAR ASPECT AGGREGATION IN ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Pavlopoulos, J. and Androutsopoulos, I.;2014;Aspect-based sentiment analysis estimates the sentiment expressed for each particular aspect (e.g., battery, screen) of an entity (e.g., smartphone). Different words or phrases, however, may be used to refer to the same aspect, and similar aspects may need to be aggregated at coarser or finer granularities to fit the available space or satisfy user preferences. We introduce the problem of aspect aggregation at multiple granularities. We decompose it in two processing phases, to allow previous work on term similarity and hierarchical clustering to be reused. We show that the second phase, where aspects are clustered, is almost a solved problem, whereas further research is needed in the first phase, where semantic similarity measures are employed. We also introduce a novel sense pruning mechanism for WordNet-based similarity measures, which improves their performance in the first phase. Finally, we provide publicly available benchmark datasets.

1274;MULTI-LINGUAL SUPPORT FOR LEXICON-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS GUIDED BY SEMANTICS;SCIENCE_DIRECT;SCIENCE_DIRECT;Alexander Hogenboom and Bas Heerschop and Flavius Frasincar and Uzay Kaymak and Franciska de Jong;2014;Abstract Many sentiment analysis methods rely on sentiment lexicons, containing words and their associated sentiment, and are tailored to one specific language. Yet, the ever-growing amount of data in different languages on the Web renders multi-lingual support increasingly important. In this paper, we assess various methods for supporting an additional target language in lexicon-based sentiment analysis. As a baseline, we automatically translate text into a reference language for which a sentiment lexicon is available, and subsequently analyze the translated text. Second, we consider mapping sentiment scores from a semantically enabled sentiment lexicon in the reference language to a new target sentiment lexicon, by traversing relations between language-specific semantic lexicons. Last, we consider creating a target sentiment lexicon by propagating sentiment of seed words in a semantic lexicon for the target language. When extending sentiment analysis from English to Dutch, mapping sentiment across languages by exploiting relations between semantic lexicons yields a significant performance improvement over the baseline of about 29% in terms of accuracy and macro-level \{F1\} on our data. Propagating sentiment in language-specific semantic lexicons can outperform the baseline by up to about 47%, depending on the seed set of sentiment-carrying words. This indicates that sentiment is not only linked to word meanings, but tends to have a language-specific dimension as well.;Decision Support Systems;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923614000645;62;43 - 53;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2014.03.004;0167-9236;Excluir

1281;ONE SEED TO FIND THEM ALL: MINING OPINION FEATURES VIA ASSOCIATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Hai, Z. and Chang, K. and Cong, G.;2012;Feature-based opinion analysis has attracted extensive attention recently. Identifying features associated with opinions expressed in reviews is essential for fine-grained opinion mining. One approach is to exploit the dependency relations that occur naturally between features and opinion words, and among features (or opinion words) themselves. In this paper, we propose a generalized approach to opinion feature extraction by incorporating robust statistical association analysis in a bootstrapping framework. The new approach starts with a small set of feature seeds, on which it iteratively enlarges by mining feature-opinion, feature-feature, and opinion-opinion dependency relations. Two association model types, namely likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and latent semantic analysis (LSA), are proposed for computing the pair-wise associations between terms (features or opinions). We accordingly propose two robust bootstrapping approaches, LRTBOOT and LSABOOT, both of which need just a handful of initial feature seeds to bootstrap opinion feature extraction. We benchmarked LRTBOOT and LSABOOT against existing approaches on a large number of real-life reviews crawled from the cellphone and hotel domains. Experimental results using varying number of feature seeds show that the proposed association-based bootstrapping approach significantly outperforms the competitors. In fact, one seed feature is all that is needed for LRTBOOT to significantly outperform the other methods. This seed feature can simply be the domain feature, e.g., --cellphone-- or --hotel--. The consequence of our discovery is far reaching: starting with just one feature seed, typically just the domain concept word, LRTBOOT can automatically extract a large set of high-quality opinion features from the corpus without any supervision or labeled features. This means that the automatic creation of a set of domain features is no longer a pipe dream!

The presented paper propose to apply the mutual information method to mine the complicated features from online reviews, and extend features extraction from the conventional word bags to regular collocations. With extracted collocation features as inputs of Naive Bayes analysis model, experiments on online hotel reviews data show that the presented extraction method improves the performance of Naive Bayes model by 1.36%, and improves the performance of Maximum Entropy model by 0.92%. On the other hand the imbalance between positive and negative reviews leads to foul play where the majority features conceal the minority ones, and also the extreme sentiment of the minority introduces noise into the dataset. With respect to the imbalance problem and corresponding parameter estimation problem, one ? feature filtering strategy and Good Turing smooth method is adopted to improve further the performance of the sentiment analysis model.;Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD), 2012 9th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1315-1319;10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233865;NULO;Incluir

Most of the current reputation models use review ratings and neglect users textual reviews, because it is more difficult to process. However, we argue that the overall reputation score for an item does not reflect the actual reputation for all of its features. And thats why the use of users textual reviews is necessary. In our work we introduce a new reputation model that defines a new aggregation method for users extracted opinions about products features from users text. Our model uses features ontology in order to define general features and sub-features of a product. It also reflects the frequencies of positive and negative opinions. We provide a case study to show how our results compare with other reputation models.;Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT), 2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on;NULO;NULO;3;37-40;10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.146;NULO;Incluir

1287;ONTOLOGY-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER POSTS;SCIENCE_DIRECT;SCIENCE_DIRECT;Efstratios Kontopoulos and Christos Berberidis and Theologos Dergiades and Nick Bassiliades;2013;The emergence of Web 2.0 has drastically altered the way users perceive the Internet, by improving information sharing, collaboration and interoperability. Micro-blogging is one of the most popular Web 2.0 applications and related services, like Twitter, have evolved into a practical means for sharing opinions on almost all aspects of everyday life. Consequently, micro-blogging web sites have since become rich data sources for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Towards this direction, text-based sentiment classifiers often prove inefficient, since tweets typically do not consist of representative and syntactically consistent words, due to the imposed character limit. This paper proposes the deployment of original ontology-based techniques towards a more efficient sentiment analysis of Twitter posts. The novelty of the proposed approach is that posts are not simply characterized by a sentiment score, as is the case with machine learning-based classifiers, but instead receive a sentiment grade for each distinct notion in the post. Overall, our proposed architecture results in a more detailed analysis of post opinions regarding a specific topic.;Expert Systems with Applications;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417413000043;40;4065 - 4074;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2013.01.001;0957-4174;Incluir

1291;OPINION DIGGER: AN UNSUPERVISED OPINION MINER FROM UNSTRUCTURED PRODUCT REVIEWS;ACM;ACM;Moghaddam, Samaneh and Ester, Martin;2010;Mining customer reviews (opinion mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction. Most of the reviewing websites such as Epinions.com provide some additional information on top of the review text and overall rating, including a set of predefined aspects and their ratings, and a rating guideline which shows the intended interpretation of the numerical ratings. However, the existing methods have ignored this additional information. We claim that using this information, which is freely available, along with the review text can effectively improve the accuracy of opinion mining. We propose an unsupervised method, called Opinion Digger, which extracts important aspects of a product and determines the overall consumers satisfaction for each, by estimating a rating in the range from 1 to 5. We demonstrate the improved effectiveness of our methods on a real life dataset that we crawled from Epinions.com.;Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management;NULO;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1871437.1871739;NULO;1825--1828;10.1145/1871437.1871739;978-1-4503-0099-5;Incluir

1294;OPINION EXTRACTION FROM CUSTOMER REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Loh, H.T. and Sun, J. and Wang, J. and Lu, W.F.;2010;The internet offers a new channel for product designers to obtain valuable information about customers opinions which are very important to product development, especially at the product concept design stage. Due to the rapid growth of such information, it is difficult for humans to manage and analyze all these information. Therefore, an alternative choice is to perform opinion mining with automatic textual mining techniques. In this research, we propose a hybrid opinion extraction (HOE) framework that can extract features and predict semantic orientation of the expressed opinions, from the free format text. The framework is inspired by capturing the characteristics of the way people express opinions, utilizes both statistical regularities of the patterns and some prior knowledge. Compared to previous work, our opinion mining technique has demonstrated its better performance in terms of extracting features and predicting semantic orientations of opinions. Thus it has the potential to be adopted by product designers as an efficient tool for quickly obtaining customer feedback.

1297;OPINION MINING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS: A RETWEETING STRUCTURE-AWARE APPROACH;IEEE_B;IEEE;Lu Lin and Jianxin Li and Zhang, R. and Weiren Yu and Chenggen Sun;2014;Microblogs have become quick and easy online information sharing platforms with the explosive growth of online social media. Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog service in China, is characterized by timeliness and interactivity. A Weibo message carries the users views and sentiments, particularly forms a fission-like spreading structure while being retweeted. Such structure accelerates information diffusion, and reflects different topics and opinions as well. However, current researches mainly focus on sentiment classification, which neither efficiently combine tree-like retweeting structure nor analyze opinion evolutions with a holistic view. In light of this, we build an opinion descriptive model, and propose an opinion mining method based on this model. With a microblog-oriented sentiment lexicon being constructed, a lexicon-based sentiment orientation analysis algorithm is designed to classify sentiments. Finally, we design and implement a prototype which can mine opinions with respect to retweeting tree structures and retweeting comments.;Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC), 2014 IEEE/ACM 7th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;890-895;10.1109/UCC.2014.145;NULO;Excluir
1298;OPINION MINING BASED ON FEATURE-LEVEL;IEEE_B;IEEE;Lizhen Liu and Zhixin Lv and Hanshi Wang;2012;An important task of opinion mining is to extract peoples opinions on features of an entity. However, for the same feature, people can express it with many different words or phrases. To produce a useful summary, these words and phrases, which are domain synonyms, need to be grouped into the same feature group. Moreover, the sentiment relatedness between the features and opinions is usually complicated. For many cases, product feature words are implied by the opinion words in reviews. A novel method is proposed to deal with the feature-level opinion mining problems. More Specially, 1) the proposed method considers the explicit features and the implicit features. 2) the opinion words are divided into two categories, vague opinion words and clear opinion words, to identify the implicit features and cluster the features. The feature clustering depends on three aspects: the corresponding opinion words, the similarity of the features and the structures of the features. Moreover, the context information is used to enhance the clustering in the procedure, which is proved to be useful in clustering. The experimental results demonstrate that our method performs well.;Image and Signal Processing (CISP), 2012 5th International Congress on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1596-1600;10.1109/CISP.2012.6469929;NULO;Incluir
1299;OPINION MINING FOR BIOMEDICAL TEXT DATA: FEATURE SPACE DESIGN AND FEATURE SELECTION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Swaminathan, R. and Sharma, A. and Yang, H.;2010;Unstructured text (e.g., journal articles) remains as the primary means for publishing biomedical research results. To extract and integrate knowledge from such data, text mining has been routinely applied. One important task is extracting relationships between bio-entities such as foods and diseases. Most existing studies however stop short of further analyzing the extracted relationships such as the polarity and the level of certainty at which the authors reported on a given relationship. The latter is termed as the relationship strength and marked at three levels-weak, medium and strong. We have previously reported a preliminary study on this issue [22], and here we detail our studies on constructing a novel feature space towards effectively predicting the polarity and strength of a relationship. Unlike previous work, four types of polarity instead of three are considered, namely, positive, negative, neutral and norelationship. Another contribution is that in addition to the commonly accepted lexicon-based features, we have identified a set of novel features that capture both the semantic and structural aspects of a relationship. Our intensive evaluations demonstrate that combining these new features with the lexicon-based ones can achieve the best accuracy for polarity prediction (âˆ¼0.91). This however is not the case for strength prediction, where lexiconbased features alone are sufficient (âˆ¼0.96).;Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining;Conference Paper;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84908309941&partnerID=40&md5=23ba0ce78edc61a14bdaa43744f99cc8;NULO;117-124;NULO;NULO;Excluir
1300;OPINION MINING FOR THAI RESTAURANT REVIEWS USING K-MEANS CLUSTERING AND MRF FEATURE SELECTION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Claypo, N. and Jaiyen, S.;2015;Opinion mining on millions of Thai restaurant reviews in an unsupervised manner is a challenging task to survey feedbacks of the customers on their products and services. This is extremely helpful for owners to improve their business. In this paper, we propose an opinion mining on Thai restaurant reviews using K-Means clustering and MRF feature selection. The proposed method begins with text preprocessing for breaking reviews into words and removing stop words, followed by text transformation for creating keywords and generating input vectors. MRF feature selection is subsequently adopted for selecting relevant features from a large number of features extracted. Then, K-Means is employed for clustering into positive and negative reviews. From the experimental results, MRF feature selection can efficiently reduce the number of features in the data set so the computational time is significantly decreased. In addition, K-means can achieve the best clustering performance, when compared with Self-Organizing Map, Fuzzy C-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering. Thus, the cooperation of K-means with MRF feature selection is an effective model for clustering Thai restaurant reviews.;Knowledge and Smart Technology (KST), 2015 7th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;105-108;10.1109/KST.2015.7051469;NULO;Excluir

1310;PARALLEL SENTIMENT POLARITY CLASSIFICATION METHOD WITH SUBSTRING FEATURE REDUCTION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Zhang, Y. and Xiang, X. and Yin, C. and Shang, L.;2013;Sentiment analysis is an important issue in machine learning, which aims to identify the emotion expressed in corpus. However, sentiment analysis is a difficult task, especially in large-scale data, where feature reduction is needed. In this paper, we propose a parallel feature reduction algorithm for sentiment polarity classification based on a substring method. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is based on parallel computing under the Hadoop platform.

1311;PARTIALLY SUPERVISED LEARNING FOR RADICAL OPINION IDENTIFICATION IN HATE GROUP WEB FORUMS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Ming Yang and Hsinchun Chen;2012;Web forums are frequently used as platforms for the exchange of information and opinions, as well as propaganda dissemination. But online content can be misused when the information being distributed, such as radical opinions, is unsolicited or inappropriate. However, radical opinion is highly hidden and distributed in Web forums, while non-radical content is unspecific and topically more diverse. It is costly and time consuming to label a large amount of radical content (positive examples) and non-radical content (negative examples) for training classification systems. Nevertheless, it is easy to obtain large volumes of unlabeled content in Web forums. In this paper, we propose and develop a topic-sensitive partially supervised learning approach to address the difficulties in radical opinion identification in hate group Web forums. Specifically, we design a labeling heuristic to extract high quality positive examples and negative examples from unlabeled datasets. The empirical evaluation results from two large hate group Web forums suggest that our proposed approach generally outperforms the benchmark techniques and exhibits more stable performance than its counterparts.;Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), 2012 IEEE International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;96-101;10.1109/ISI.2012.6284099;NULO;Excluir
1312;PERFORMING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN BANGLA MICROBLOG POSTS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Chowdhury, S. and Chowdhury, W.;2014;Much of the research work on sentiment analysis has been carried out in the English language, but work in Bangla is limited to only news corpus and blogs. Microblogging sites are becoming a valuable source for publishing huge volumes of user-generated information, as users express their views, opinions, and sentiments over various topics. In this paper, we aim to automatically extract the sentiments or opinions conveyed by users from Bangla microblog posts and then identify the overall polarity of texts as either negative or positive. We use a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for the development of the training corpus which avoids the need for labor intensive manual annotation. For classification, we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and do a comparative analysis on the performance of these two machine learning algorithms by experimenting with a combination of various sets of features.;Informatics, Electronics Vision (ICIEV), 2014 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1-6;10.1109/ICIEV.2014.6850712;NULO;Excluir
1313;POLARITY ANALYSIS BASED ON AN IMPROVED FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHM;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Weixin, T.a  and Sheng, Z.b  and Anhui, W.a;2011;Polarity analysis is a technique that analyzes text according to the attitude implied from it. Since the correspondence between the attitude and surface word features is subtle, the ordinary methods for topical text analysis are not sufficient for polarity analysis. This paper proposed a classification method combined with feature selection algorithm to the problem. Firstly, all possible feature schemas are designed and features are collected. Then a feature selection algorithm named improved SIMBA is used to distill the candidate features. In the last, the selected features are used as clues for a standard classifier. Experiment shows that the performance is better than that of previous method on the same dataset.

1314;POLARITY IDENTIFICATION OF SENTIMENT WORDS BASED ON EMOTICONS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Shuigui Huang and Wenwen Han and Xirong Que and Wendong Wang;2013;The orientation of sentiment words plays an important role in the sentiment analysis, but existing methods have difficulty in classifying the orientation of Chinese words, especially for the newly emerged words in Internet. Most approaches are mining the association between sentiment words and seed words using the big corpora and manually labeled seed words with definite orientation. But less work has ever focused on the efficient seed words selection. As we observed, emoticons, which are widely used on social network because of the simplicity and visualization, are good indicators for sentiment orientation. Thus this paper proposes the sentiment word model based on emoticons, which built orientation model of sentiment words with the orientation of emoticons, and train the model with the SVM classifier. Meanwhile, this work proposes a high efficient way to automatically classify the orientation of emoticons. Experiments show the precision rate of emoticon classification could reach 93.6%, and that of sentiment words classification could be 81.5%.;Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS), 2013 9th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;134-138;10.1109/CIS.2013.35;NULO;Excluir

An effective solution to automate the sentiment analysis of such large amounts of online financial texts would be extremely beneficial. This paper presents a natural language processing (NLP) based pre-processing approach both for noise removal from raw online financial texts and for organizing such texts into an enhanced format that is more usable for feature extraction. The proposed approach integrates six NLP processing steps, including a developed syntactic and semantic combined negation handling algorithm, to reduce noise in the online informal text. Three-class sentiment classification is also introduced in each system implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed pre-processing approach outperforms other pre-processing methods.

1316;PREDICTING CONSUMER SENTIMENTS FROM ONLINE TEXT;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Bai, X.;2011;Sentiment analysis from unstructured text has witnessed a boom in interest in recent years, due to the sheer volume of online reviews and news corpora available in digital form. An accurate method for predicting sentiments could enable us, for instance, to extract opinions from the Internet and gauge online customers preferences, which could prove valuable for economic or marketing research, for leveraging a strategic advantage for an enterprise, or for detecting cyber risk and security threats. In this paper, we propose a heuristic search-enhanced Markov blanket model that is able to capture the dependencies among words and provide a vocabulary that is adequate for the purpose of extracting sentiments. Computational results on two collections of online movie reviews and three collections of online news show that our method is able to identify a parsimonious set of predictive features, yet simultaneously yield comparable or better prediction results about sentiment orientations, than several state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms as well as sentiment prediction methods. Our results suggest that sentiments are captured by conditional dependencies among words as well as by keywords or high-frequency words. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

1317;PROBABILISTIC ASPECT MINING MODEL FOR DRUG REVIEWS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Cheng, V.C. and Leung, C.H.C. and Jiming Liu and Milani, A.;2014;Recent findings show that online reviews, blogs, and discussion forums on chronic diseases and drugs are becoming important supporting resources for patients. Extracting information from these substantial bodies of texts is useful and challenging. We developed a generative probabilistic aspect mining model (PAMM) for identifying the aspects/topics relating to class labels or categorical meta-information of a corpus. Unlike many other unsupervised approaches or supervised approaches, PAMM has a unique feature in that it focuses on finding aspects relating to one class only rather than finding aspects for all classes simultaneously in each execution. This reduces the chance of having aspects formed from mixing concepts of different classes:, hence the identified aspects are easier to be interpreted by people. The aspects found also have the property that they are class distinguishing: They can be used to distinguish a class from other classes. An efficient EM-algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. Experimental results on reviews of four different drugs show that PAMM is able to find better aspects than other common approaches, when measured with mean pointwise mutual information and classification accuracy. In addition, the derived aspects were also assessed by humans based on different specified perspectives, and PAMM was found to be rated highest.;Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on;NULO;NULO;26;2002-2013;10.1109/TKDE.2013.175;1041-4347;Incluir

Sentiment analysis of tweets can potentially benefit different parties, such as consumers and marketing researchers, for obtaining opinions on different products and services. We present methods for text normalization of the noisy tweets and their classification with respect to the polarity. We experiment with a mixture model approach for generation of sentimental words, which are later used as indicator features of the classification model.

1320;PRODUCT ASPECT EXTRACTION SUPERVISED WITH ONLINE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE;SCIENCE_DIRECT;SCIENCE_DIRECT;Tao Wang and Yi Cai and Ho-fung Leung and Raymond Y.K. Lau and Qing Li and Huaqing Min;2014;Abstract One of the most challenging problems in aspect-based opinion mining is aspect extraction, which aims to identify expressions that describe aspects of products (called aspect expressions) and categorize domain-specific synonymous expressions. Although a number of methods of aspect extraction have been proposed before, very few of them are designed to improve the interpretability of generated aspects. Existing methods either generate multiple fine-grained aspects without proper categorization or categorize semantically unrelated product aspects (e.g., by unsupervised topic modeling). In this paper, we first examine previous studies on product aspect extraction. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, two novel semi-supervised models for product aspect extraction are then proposed. More specifically, the proposed methodology first extracts seeding aspects and related terms from detailed product descriptions readily available on E-commerce websites. Next, product reviews are regrouped according to these seeding aspects so that more effective textual contexts for topic modeling are built. Finally, two novel semi-supervised topic models are developed to extract human-comprehensible product aspects. For the first proposed topic model, the Fine-grained Labeled \{LDA\} (FL-LDA), seeding aspects are applied to guide the model to discover words that are related to these seeding aspects. For the second model, the Unified Fine-grained Labeled \{LDA\} (UFL-LDA), we incorporate unlabeled documents to extend the FL-LDA model so that words related to the seeding aspects or other high-frequency words in customer reviews are extracted. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods.;Knowledge-Based Systems;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705114002081;71;86 - 100;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2014.05.018;0950-7051;Incluir
1321;PRODUCT EVALUATION USING MINING AND RATING OPINIONS OF PRODUCT FEATURES;IEEE_B;IEEE;Karkare, V.Y. and Gupta, S.R.;2014;Because of increase in social networking, more and more people are connected. The people use to share information using these sites and also through the personal blogs. This information sharing is done globally. As the Internet Technology is becoming reliable, people feel safe while sharing the information. Other than messages and photos, this information also includes opinions, experiences and feedbacks regarding any product. These opinions and feedbacks are very important for the organizations that are selling or manufacturing the products, which can be used for changing designs, personalization and better understanding of product. This information is very useful for people or customer for buying the product. But for a customer, it is very difficult to review all the opinions or feedbacks available on net for a particular product. So, data mining approaches are used to mine the opinions, perform summarization of reviews for a particular product based on features or any other category. Most of the existing methods are processing the reviews in terms of positive and negative comments. But this approach is not enough for a customer to make decision about product. The proposed approach not only finding the positive and negative comments for any product or product features, but also rating them in the order of positivity and negativity. Also, the proposed approach gives the degree of comparisons for a particular product and product features.;Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies (ICESC), 2014 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;382-385;10.1109/ICESC.2014.72;NULO;Incluir
1322;PRODUCT FEATURE CATEGORIZATION WITH MULTILEVEL LATENT SEMANTIC ASSOCIATION;ACM;ACM;Guo, Honglei and Zhu, Huijia and Guo, Zhili and Zhang, XiaoXun and Su, Zhong;2009;In recent years, the number of freely available online reviews is increasing at a high speed. Aspect-based opinion mining technique has been employed to find out reviewers opinions toward different product aspects. Such finer-grained opinion mining is valuable for the potential customers to make their purchase decisions. Product-feature extraction and categorization is very important for better mining aspect-oriented opinions. Since people usually use different words to describe the same aspect in the reviews, product-feature extraction and categorization becomes more challenging. Manually product-feature extraction and categorization is tedious and time consuming, and practically infeasible for the massive amount of products. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised product-feature categorization method with multilevel latent semantic association. After extracting product-features from the semi-structured reviews, we construct the first latent semantic association (LaSA) model to group words into a set of concepts according to their virtual context documents. It generates the latent semantic structure for each product-feature. The second LaSA model is constructed to categorize the product-features according to their latent semantic structures and context snippets in the reviews. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared with the existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed method is language- and domain-independent.;Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management;NULO;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1645953.1646091;NULO;1087--1096;10.1145/1645953.1646091;978-1-60558-512-3;Incluir

While there is some progress in supervised classification of opinion, the unsupervised learning of product features has drawn less attention. Unlike previous approaches based on basic syntactic pattern, our product feature mining utilizes syntactic dependency knowledge in a novel way by discriminating nominal and non-nominal terms. A nominal semantic structure will be parsed based on a dependency tree together with our model treating non-nominal terms as the semantic neighbors of the associated nominal terms. The semantic structure parsing will produce an opinionated pair stream with couples of nominal terms and its semantic neighbors, based on which fine-grained product features can be obtained by co-clustering approach via factorization method.

Most existing approaches only find individual features about a product without revealing the structural relationships between the features which usually exist.

1330;QUALITY EVALUATION OF PRODUCT REVIEWS USING AN INFORMATION QUALITY FRAMEWORK;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Chen, C.C. and Tseng, Y.-D.;2011;The ubiquity of Web2.0 makes the Web an invaluable source of business information. For instance, product reviews composed collaboratively by many independent Internet reviewers can help consumers make purchase decisions and enable enterprises to improve their business strategies. As the number of reviews is increasing exponentially, opinion mining and retrieval techniques are needed to identify important reviews and opinions to answer users queries. Most opinion mining and retrieval approaches try to extract sentimental or bipolar expressions from a large volume of reviews. However, the process often ignores the quality of each review and may retrieve useless or even noisy documents.

1337;RESEARCH ON THE AUTOMATIC EVALUATION OF MERCHANDISE COMMENTS ON BLOGS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Qian Liping and Yang Xiaoping and Wang Lidong;2010;Opinionated content in Blog comments usually has a positive or a negative or a neutral connotation. This paper researches on the automatic evaluation of Blog comments on merchandise. It builds a meta-search engine for retrieving Blog pages with merchandise comments. The retrieved pages are parsed:, the comment texts are drawn out and serve as resources for corpus. By means of feature extraction and polarity analysis, these comments text are represented with SVM. In polarity analyzing, a dictionary of merchandise attributes and a lexicon of positive and negative words are constructed to improve the accuracy. The average score of specific product is calculated based on the polarity score of each merchandise attribute and the percentage of people who gives positive comment. We build a prototype system AESBC and conduct comparison study between the result of our experimental system and that of field experts. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of our method.;Web Information Systems and Mining (WISM), 2010 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;1;293-296;10.1109/WISM.2010.57;NULO;Excluir
1338;RESTRICTED DOMAIN OPINION MINING IN COMPOUND SENTENCES;IEEE_B;IEEE;Mishra, N. and Jha, C.K.;2013;The growing availability of opinion rich resources like online review sites and blogs arises as people can easily seek out and understand the opinions of others. Users express their views and opinions that could be simple or compound sentence which is related to the products and services. These opinions are subjective information which represents users sentiments, feelings or appraisal related to the same. With respect to compound sentences there are number of problems in opinion mining such as identification of object features, their individual sentiments and sentiments of overall object as a whole. This paper is an extension to our work on semantic question answering in which we identify the score of the asked feature by deriving it from the question through opinion mining in compound sentences. Our method shows significant improvement on movie-review dataset.;Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT), 2013 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;616-620;10.1109/CSNT.2013.132;NULO;Excluir

This paper describes an approach that combines opinion target extrac- tion with aspect extraction using syntactic patterns. It ex- pands previous work limited by sentence boundaries and in- cludes a heuristic for anaphora resolution to identify targets across sentences. Furthermore, it demonstrates the applica- tion of concepts known from research on open information extraction to the identification of relevant opinion aspects. Qualitative analyses performed on a corpus of 100 000 Ama- zon product reviews show that the approach is promising.

1341;SARCASM DETECTION IN SOCIAL MEDIA BASED ON IMBALANCED CLASSIFICATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Liu, P.a  b  c  and Chen, W.a  b  and Ou, G.a  b  and Wang, T.a  b  and Yang, D.a  b  and Lei, K.c;2014;Sarcasm is a pervasive linguistic phenomenon in online documents that express subjective and deeply-felt opinions. Detection of sarcasm is of great importance and beneficial to many NLP applications, such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and advertising. Current studies consider automatic sarcasm detection as a simple text classification problem. They do not use explicit features to detect sarcasm and ignore the imbalance between sarcastic and non-sarcastic samples in real applications. In this paper, we first explore the characteristics of both English and Chinese sarcastic sentences and introduce a set of features specifically for detecting sarcasm in social media. Then, we propose a novel multi-strategy ensemble learning approach(MSELA) to handle the imbalance problem. We evaluate our proposed model on English and Chinese data sets. Experimental results show that our ensemble approach outperforms the state-of-the-art sarcasm detection approaches and popular imbalanced classification methods.

1342;SARCASM DETECTION USING SENTIMENT AND SEMANTIC FEATURES;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Nagwanshi, P. and Veni Madhavan, C.E.;2014;Sarcasm is a figure of speech used to express a strong opinion in a mild manner. It is often used to convey the opposite sense of what is expressed. Automatic recognition of sarcasm is a complex task. Sarcasm detection is of importance in effective opinion mining. Most sarcasm detectors use lexical and pragmatic features for this purpose. We incorporate statistical as well as linguistic features. Our approach considers the semantic and flipping of sentiment as main features. We use machine learning techniques for classification of sarcastic statements. We conduct experiments on different types of data sets, and compare our results with an existing approach in the literature. We also present human evaluation results.

Although sentiment classifiers typically perform poorly when transferred across domains, experimentation reveals the devised approaches offer performance equivalent to the traditional forum-specific approach in classification in an unknown domain.

1344;SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND IMPLICIT TARGET EXTRACTION OF COMMENTS FROM E-COMMERCE WEBSITES;IEEE_B;IEEE;Hui Song and Jianfeng Chu and Yun Hu and Xiaoqiang Liu;2013;In e-commerce websites, customers usually make comments, which include the properties of the product, the attitude to the vendor, express delivery information after buying the products. The information provides an important reference when others buy products in the website. In sentiment analysis, a finer-grained opinion mining approach focuses on not only the product itself as a whole but also product features, which can be a part or attribute of the product. Previous related research focuses on the explicit target mining but neglects the implicit ones. Whereas, the implicit features, which are implied by some words or phrases, are very significant and meaningful to express users opinion. In this paper, we propose a new approach to uniformly extract explicit and implicit opinion features from the comments. Our experimental results prove the effectiveness of the approach. The recall is improved, suggesting that taking the implicit features into consideration can extract more useful information, meanwhile, the precision is stable, not decreases.;Software Engineering (WCSE), 2013 Fourth World Congress on;NULO;NULO;NULO;331-335;10.1109/WCSE.2013.62;NULO;Incluir
1345;SEMANTIC APPROACHES TO FINE AND COARSE-GRAINED FEATURE-BASED OPINION MINING;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Balahur, A. and Montoyo, A.;2009;Feature-based opinion mining from product reviews is a difficult task, both due to the high semantic variability of opinion expression, as well as because of the diversity of characteristics and sub-characteristics describing the products and the multitude of opinion words used to depict them. Further on, this task supposes not only the discovery of directly expressed opinions, but also the extraction of phrases that indirectly or implicitly value objects and their characteristics, by means of emotions or attitudes. Last, but not least, evaluation of results is difficult, because there is no standard corpus available that is annotated at such a fine-grained level and no annotation scheme defined for this purpose. This article presents our contributions to this task, given by the definition and application of an opinion annotation scheme, the testing of different methodologies to detect phrases related to different characteristics and the employment of Textual Entailment recognition for opinion mining. Finally, we test our approaches both on the built corpus, as well as on an ad-hoc built collection of reviews that we evaluate on the basis of the stars given. We prove that our approaches are appropriate and give high precision results.

1347;SEMANTIC ORIENTATION APPROACH FOR SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Veeraselvi, S.J. and Saranya, C.;2014;Opinions are the fundamental aspect to almost all decision making activities. The increased usage of internet and the exchange of user opinions through social media and public forums on the web has become the motivation for sentiment analysis. Due to the infinite amount of user opinions available throughout the web it is necessary to automatically analyze and classify sentiment expressed in opinions. The basic task of sentiment analysis or opinion mining is sentiment classification which classifies the content as positive, negative and irrelevant. This paper discusses an approach where an exposed stream of tweets from the Twitter micro blogging site are preprocessed and classified based on their sentiments. In sentiment classification system the concept of opinion subjectivity has been accounted. In this paper, we present opinion detection and organization subsystem, which have already been integrated into our larger question-answering system. The subjectivity classification system uses Genetic-Based Machine Learning (GBML) technique that considers subjectivity as a semantic problem. The classification of a review is predicted through the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs.

1348;SEMI-SUPERVISED CHINESE CONTEXTUAL POLARITY CLASSIFICATION WITH AUTOMATIC FEATURE SELECTION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Ge Xu and Houfeng Wang;2011;Common approaches to the tasks of sentiment analysis start with a list of words with prior polarities, which are context-free. However, a word can exhibit different polarities in different contexts, which are termed as contextual polarities. In this paper, viewing polarities of words as properties of word senses, we treat the Chinese contextual polarity classification as word sense disambiguation (WSD), and manually labeled a Chinese dataset for training and testing. Due to the insufficiency of labeled data, semi-supervised methods are adopted:, to find the effective features for the contextual polarity classification, two automatic feature selection algorithms are proposed. We combine the semi-supervised methods with automatic feature selection algorithms in order to utilize the strengths of both. The experimental results show that the semi-supervised methods, automatic feature selection, and the combination of both help to improve the Chinese contextual polarity classification above a supervised baseline model.;Natural Computation (ICNC), 2011 Seventh International Conference on;NULO;NULO;2;1019-1023;10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022245;2157-9555;Excluir
1349;SENTENCE BASED SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION FROM ONLINE CUSTOMER REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Khan, A. and Baharudin, B. and Khan, K.;2010;Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing and classifying the rewires contents about a product, event, and place etc into positive, negative or neutral opinion. In this paper:, we propose a sentence level machine learning approach for sentiment classification of online reviews. The proposed method extracts the subjective sentences from the reviews and label each sentence either positive or negative based on its word level feature using naÃ¯ve NÃ¤ve Bayesian (NB) classifier. The labeled sentences create an annotated set of sentences called as BOS (Bag-of-Sentences). We train Support Vector machine (SVM) classifier on the BOS for sentences polarity classification. The contextual information in each sentence structure is taken into consideration to calculate the semantic orientation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated thought simulation. Results show that our machine learning based proposed method on average achieves accuracy of 81% and 83% with some contextual information. This method improves the sentiment classification polarity on sentence level unlike the word level lexical feature based work, by focus on sentences, this also concentrate on contextual information.

1357;SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON TRANSFER LEARNING FOR CHINESE ANCIENT LITERATURE;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zhao, Huidong and Wu, Bin and Wang, Haoyu and Shi, Chuan;2014;With the rise of computational social science, analyzing sociological problems using computational methods has attracted widespread attention. In recent years, sentiment analysis has become a research hotspot in computational social science. But existing researches concentrate on modern text, such as product reviews and microblogging, and hardly involve the analysis of ancient literature. In this paper, we propose a model TL-PCO based on transfer learning to classify ancient literature, then through sentiments in ancient literature we can understand social and cultural development in that era. Our model utilizes the knowledge of ancient literature itself and the corresponding modern translation. Through two proposed functions based on transfer learning we can get two kinds of features. With the addition of features from ancient literature itself, three classifiers can be trained and then vote for the final category. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the dataset of Chinese poems in Tang Dynasty. Moreover, the different periods of Tang Dynasty and different genres are analyzed in detail.

1358;SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR PRODUCT FEATURES IN CHINESE REVIEWS BASED ON SEMANTIC ASSOCIATION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Chunxia Yin and Qinke Peng;2009;Often there are more than one topic, more than one holder and more than one sentiment in an opinion sentence. But currently the studies on sentiment analysis are unable to identify exactly which sentiments a holder expresses on a given topic, so these are experimented based on the hypothesis, which is obviously unreasonable, that a review or a sentence have only a holder and a topic. The paper aims at addressing sentiment analysis for product features in product reviews written in Chinese by building the semantic associations between product features and sentiment words. The patterns, which identify semantic associations between sentiment words and features, and the approach, which builds the sentiment list of each feature, are proposed. The sentiment list of each feature is built up in the course of building semantic associations related to the feature. Using sentiment lists, the average sentiment expressed on each feature can be obtained. Our method is unsupervised.

1359;SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES: FEATURE SELECTION FOR OPINION CLASSIFICATION IN WEB FORUMS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Abbasi, A.a  b  and Chen, H.a  b  and Salem, A.a  b;2008;The Internet is frequently used as a medium for exchange of information and opinions, as well as propaganda dissemination. In this study the use of sentiment analysis methodologies is proposed for classification of Web forum opinions in multiple languages. The utility of stylistic and syntactic features is evaluated for sentiment classification of English and Arabic content. Specific feature extraction components are integrated to account for the linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The entropy weighted genetic algorithm (EWGA) is also developed, which is a hybridized genetic algorithm that incorporates the information-gain heuristic for feature selection. EWGA is designed to improve performance and get a better assessment of key features. The proposed features and techniques are evaluated on a benchmark movie review dataset and U.S. and Middle Eastern Web forum postings. The experimental results using EWGA with SVM indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 91% on the benchmark dataset as well as the U.S. and Middle Eastern forums. Stylistic features significantly enhanced performance across all testbeds while EWGA also outperformed other feature selection methods, indicating the utility of these features and techniques for document-level classification of sentiments.

1362;SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF CHINESE MICRO-BLOG USING VECTOR SPACE MODEL;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zhi-Qiang Xiang and Zou, Y.X. and Xin Wang;2014;In recent years, mining micro-blog becomes a hot research field, especially it may create commercial and political values in a fast changing big data era. This paper investigates the sentiment analysis of Chinese micro-blogs (SACM) using a vector space model. With the analysis of the nature properties of the Chinese micro-blogs, a sentiment analysis system has been proposed by formulating it as a two-type classification problem whether positive sentiment or negative sentiment. To achieve robust results, a preprocessing approach has been developed to remove the emotional unrelated words, transform the traditional expression to simplified one, and unify the punctuation by analyzing the dynamic and complicated micro-blog expressions. Besides, with aids of word segmentation and frequency statistical techniques the vector space model has been formed to generate the sentiment-related micro-blog feature vector. The support vector machine (SVM) has been taken as the classifier for its excellent ability in solving two-class classification problem. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate the proposed sentiment analysis system. Three different databases have been used in word segmentation stage including the emotion dictionary from Dalian University of Technology, CNKI-Hownet emotional dictionary and our self-established dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed SACM system is able to achieve 80.86% classification accuracy using above databases.;Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association, 2014 Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA);NULO;NULO;NULO;1-5;10.1109/APSIPA.2014.7041745;NULO;Excluir

K. and Piryani, R. and Uddin, A. and Waila, P. and Ieee;2013;This paper presents our experimental work on a new kind of domain specific feature-based heuristic for aspect-level sentiment analysis of movie reviews. We have devised an aspect oriented scheme that analyses the textual reviews of a movie and assign it a sentiment label on each aspect. The scores on each aspect from multiple reviews are then aggregated and a net sentiment profile of the movie is generated on all parameters. We have used a SentiWordNet based scheme with two different linguistic feature selections comprising of adjectives, adverbs and verbs and n-gram feature extraction. We have also used our SentiWordNet scheme to compute the document-level sentiment for each movie reviewed and compared the results with results obtained using Alchemy API. The sentiment profile of a movie is also compared with the document-level sentiment result. The results obtained show that our scheme produces a more accurate and focused sentiment profile than the simple document-level sentiment analysis.;2013 Ieee International Multi Conference on Automation, Computing, Communication, Control and Compressed Sensing (Imac4s);Journal Article;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000324694700126;NULO;712-717;NULO;NULO;Excluir

In this paper we propose a new topic sentiment mixture model which we call Semi-supervised Co-LDA model to obtain the positive and negative opinions from the reviews about each product. The Semi-supervised Co-LDA can model the topic and sentiment of the product reviews simultaneously. The Semi-supervised Co-LDA model we proposed is a semi-supervised model, which utilizes the well-written expert reviews as labeled data. The Co-LDA model has an additional advantage that can integrate expert opinions and ordinary opinions. Empirical experiments on the online reviews datasets from CNET show that this approach is effective for topic sentiment analysis of the product.

Though polarity classification has been extensively studied at different document-structure levels (e.g. document, sentence, words), little work has been done investigating feature selection methods and subjectivity resources. We systematically analyze four different English subjectivity resources for the task of sentiment polarity identification. While the results show that the size of dictionaries clearly correlate to polarity-based feature coverage, this property does not correlate to classification accuracy. Using polarity-based feature selection, considering a minimum amount of prior polarity features, in combination with SVM-based machine learning methods exhibits the best performance (acc = 84.1 ,f1 = 83.9), in comparison to the classical approaches on polarity identification. Based on the findings of the English-based experimental setup, a new German subjectivity resource is proposed for the task of German-based sentiment analysis.

1380;SENTIMENT ANALYZER: ANALYSIS OF JOURNAL CITATIONS FROM CITATION DATABASES;IEEE_B;IEEE;Parthasarathy, G. and Tomar, D.C.;2014;The process of finding out the frequency of citations for various journals or articles or research papers is known as citation analysis. The impact of any research paper can be found by computing the number of citations, the particular journal or paper received. Many researchers quote concepts or ideas from various papers and the final outcome of the paper in their discussion. But it does not always mean that all the authors and papers referred to would be criticizing the referred paper with positive words. Sometimes if the referring paper has produced good results when compared to the referred paper then obviously the authors do not give much positive comments in their discussion. In order to address this problem, we propose the sentiment analysis can be performed to rate the citations based on the polarity level. The sentence parser can be used to identify the adjectives what the authors used in their discussion about the cited paper. Then the identified adjectives can be assigned a score to distinguish it from positive and negative. In between, if any paper is found without clearly mentioning the cited paper with identifiable adjective terms then in can be named as unknown or neutral. The citations can be ranked based on the computed polarity score. The ranking process helps to project the citations which have cited with higher positivity content in their discussion.;Confluence The Next Generation Information Technology Summit (Confluence), 2014 5th International Conference -;NULO;NULO;NULO;923-928;10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2014.6949321;NULO;Excluir

In decision making, the opinions of others have a significant effect on customers, ease in making choices regards to online shopping, choosing events, products, entities, etc. When an important decision needs to be made, consumers usually want to know the opinion, sentiment and emotion of others. With rapidly growing online resources such as online discussion groups, forums and blogs, people are commentating via the Internet. As a result, a vast amount of new data in the form of customer reviews, comments and opinions about products, events and entities are being generated more and more. So it is desired to develop an efficient and effective sentiment analysis system for online customer reviews and comments. In this paper, the rule based domain independent sentiment analysis method is proposed. The proposed method classifies subjective and objective sentences from reviews and blog comments. The semantic score of subjective sentences is extracted from SentiWordNet to calculate their polarity as positive, negative or neutral based on the contextual sentence structure. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and it outperforms the word level and machine learning methods. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 97.8% at the feedback level and 86.6% at the sentence level.

Up to now there are very few researches conducted on sentiment analysis for Persian documents. This paper considers the problem of sentiment classification for online customer reviews in Persian language. One of the challenges of Persian language is using of a wide variety of declensional suffixes. Another common problem of Persian text is word spacing. In Persian in addition to white space as interwords space, an intra-word space called pseudo-space separates words part. One more noticeable challenge in customer reviews in Persian language is that of utilizing many informal or colloquial words in text. In this paper we study these challenges by proposing a model for sentiment classification of Persian review documents. The proposed model is based on a lemmatization approach for Persian language and is employed Naive Bayes learning algorithm for classification. Additionally we present a new feature selection method based on the mutual information method to extract the best feature collection from the initial extracted features. Finally we evaluate the performance of the model on a manually gathered collection of cellphone reviews, where the results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.;Electrical Engineering (ICEE), 2013 21st Iranian Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1-6;10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599671;NULO;Excluir

1391;SENTIMENT DETECTION AND VISUALIZATION OF CHINESE MICRO-BLOG;IEEE_B;IEEE;Zhitao Wang and Zhiwen Yu and Liming Chen and Bin Guo;2014;Micro-blog has been increasingly used for the public to express their opinions, and for organisations to detect public sentiment about social events. In contrast to the effort and progress made in English-based micro-blog analysis, research on Chinese micro-blog received relatively little attention. In this paper we examine and identify the key problems of this field, focusing particularly on the characteristics of innovative words, emoticon elements and hierarchical structure of Chinese Weibo. Based on the analysis we propose and develop associated theoretical and technological methods to address these problems. These include the development of new sentiment word mining method based on three wording standards and point-wise metrics, a rule set model for analyzing sentiment features of different linguistic components, and the corresponding methodology for calculating sentiment on multi-granularity considering emoticon elements. We use original Chinese tweets from a dataset of Sina Weibo to test and evaluate our new word discovery and sentiment detection methods. Initial results show that our new diction can improve sentiment detection, and demonstrate that our multi-level rule set method is more effective by giving 10.2% and 1.5% higher average accuracy than two existing methods for Chinese micro-blog sentiment analysis. In addition, we exploit visualisation techniques to study the relationships between online sentiment and real life, which can help depict the correlation between public emotions and events.;Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), 2014 International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;251-257;10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058081;NULO;Excluir

1393;SENTIMENT FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHM FOR CHINESE MICRO-BLOG;IEEE_B;IEEE;Yu Jian Kun and Zhao Lei;2014;Sentiment analysis is to extract the opinion of the user from of the text documents. Sentiment classification using machine learning methods face problem of handing huge number of unique terms in a feature vector for the classification. Therefore, a feature selection method is required to eliminate the irrelevant and noisy features from the feature vector for efficient working of ML algorithms. Rought set Theory based feature selection method is not good at Chinese text although it did well in English text. In this paper, improved feature selection methods are proposed which are based on rough set theory and adapt to the Chinese micro blog. We name them as IGAR (IG and Rough set) and CHIAR (CHI and Rough set). The performance of the improved feature selection methods are compared with Information Gain (IG) method which has been identified as one of the best feature selection method for sentiment classification. Experimentation of improved feature selection methods was performed on two datasets which are extracted from Sina microblog.

This unique source of data provides a rapid means of customer feedback that is used to support a number of business areas. Towards this purpose, we describe a methodology for the identification of topics associated with customer sentiment. This process first employs a Fisher Classification based approach towards sentiment analysis. By considering specific mutual information and word frequency distribution, topics are then identified within sentiment categories. The goal is to provide overall trends in sentiment along with associated subject matter (ie. why) as it supports a companys business.

1396;SENTIMENT POLARITY IDENTIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Chiorean, R.-S. and Dinsoreanu, M. and Faloba, D.-I. and Potolea, R.;2013;The paper proposes an improved approach to the problem of sentiment polarity identification. Its main focus is on identifying and extracting the relevant information from natural language texts in order to obtain a set of best predictive features to be used for the classification task. Our approach of determining the polarity of a text consists of a combination of several processing techniques that obtains an efficient set of appropriate information for the underlying text. Among techniques, we have considered pruning the feature set to discard features without polarity or with less discriminative power, since their presence tend to mislead the learning process. Moreover, using word co-occurrence techniques, new composed bi-grams with high discriminative power are added which enhances the classification process. The best results are obtained using different combinations of techniques, depending on the datasets homogeneity. On a homogeneous dataset, the performance in terms of precision is approximately 88% and, in terms of recall, a value of 93% is reached. In the case of a diverse dataset, the performance attained is 100%.

1397;SENTIMENT RETRIEVAL ON WEB REVIEWS USING SPONTANEOUS NATURAL SPEECH;IEEE_B;IEEE;Costa Pereira, J. and Luque, J. and Anguera, X.;2014;This paper addresses the problem of document retrieval based on sentiment polarity criteria. A query based on natural spontaneous speech, expressing an opinion about a certain topic, is used to search a repository of documents containing favorable or unfavorable opinions. The goal is to retrieve documents whose opinions more closely resemble the one in the query. A semantic system based on speech transcripts is augmented with information from full-length text articles. Posterior probabilities extracted from the articles are used to regularize their transcription counterparts. This paper makes three important contributions. First, we introduce a framework for polarity analysis of sentiments that can accommodate combinations of different modalities capable of dealing with the absence of any modality. Second, we show that it is possible to improve average precision on speech transcriptions sentiment retrieval by means of regularization.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a retrieval framework known as Cross-Domain Sentiment Search (CSS), which combines the usage of domain ontologies with specific linguistic rules to handle sentiment terms in textual data. The CSS framework also supports incrementally enriching domain ontologies when applied in new domains. Findings - The authors found that domain ontologies are extremely helpful when CSS is applied in specific domains. In the meantime, the embedded linguistic rules make CSS achieve better performance as compared to data mining techniques. Research limitations/implications - The approach has been initially applied in a real social monitoring system of a professional IT company. Thus, it is proved to be able to handle real data acquired from social media channels such as electronic newspapers or social networks. Originality/value - The authors have placed aspect-based sentiment analysis in the context of semantic search and introduced the CSS framework for the whole sentiment search process.

1402;SENTIX: AN ASPECT AND DOMAIN SENSITIVE SENTIMENT LEXICON;IEEE_B;IEEE;Hsiang Hui Lek and Poo, D.C.C.;2012;Sentiment lexicons have often been used to aid sentiment analysis. Most of these sentiment lexicons are general-purpose lexicons which assign a fixed polarity to every word. However, it has been noted that the polarity of words depends on both the aspect and domain, thus a general-purpose sentiment lexicon would not be able to accurately classify the sentiment of words. This paper proposes a method to automatically construct an aspect and domain sensitive sentiment lexicon which assigns polarity to a word depending on its aspect and domain, and make available Sentix which is an aspect and domain sensitive sentiment lexicon spanning over 200 product domains. Experimental results have shown that our lexicon produces significantly better results compared to other commonly used lexicons. We also observe the long tail distribution behavior of product aspects, and propose the possibility of aspect ranking by comparing the number of domains and number of sentiment words present for an aspect.;Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI), 2012 IEEE 24th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;1;261-268;10.1109/ICTAI.2012.43;1082-3409;Incluir

1404;SHORT TEXT CATEGORIZATION VIA COHERENCE CONSTRAINTS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Dinu, A.;2011;In this article we propose a quantitative approach to a relatively new problem: categorizing text as pragmatically correct or pragmatically incorrect (forcing the notion, coherent/incoherent). The typical text categorization criterions comprise categorization by topic, by style (genre classification, authorship identification), by expressed opinion (opinion mining, sentiment classification), etc. Very few approaches consider the problem of categorizing text by degree of coherence. One example of application of text categorization by its coherence is creating a spam filter for personal e-mail accounts able to cope with one of the new strategies adopted by spamers. This strategy consists of encoding the real message as picture (impossible to directly analyze and reject by the text oriented classical filters) and accompanying it by a text especially designed to surpass the filter. An important question for automatically categorizing texts into coherent and incoherent is: are there features that can be extracted from these texts and be successfully used to categorize them? We propose a quantitative approach that relies on the use of ratios between morphological categories from the texts as discriminant features. We use supervised machine learning techniques on a small corpus of English e-mail messages and let the algorithms extract important features from all the pos ratios.

1405;SHOW ME THE MONEY!: DERIVING THE PRICING POWER OF PRODUCT FEATURES BY MINING CONSUMER REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Archak, N. and Ghose, A. and Ipeirotis, P.G.;2007;The increasing pervasiveness of the Internet has dramatically changed the way that consumers shop for goods. Consumer-generated product reviews have become a valuable source of information for customers, who read the reviews and decide whether to buy the product based on the information provided. In this paper, we use techniques that decompose the reviews into segments that evaluate the individual characteristics of a product (e.g., image quality and battery life for a digital camera). Then, as a major contribution of this paper, we adapt methods from the econometrics literature, specifically the hedonic regression concept, to estimate: (a) the weight that customers place on each individual product feature, (b) the implicit evaluation score that customers assign to each feature, and (c) how these evaluations affect the revenue for a given product. Towards this goal, we develop a novel hybrid technique combining text mining and econometrics that models consumer product reviews as elements in a tensor product of feature and evaluation spaces. We then impute the quantitative impact of consumer reviews on product demand as a linear functional from this tensor product space. We demonstrate how to use a low-dimension approximation of this functional to significantly reduce the number of model parameters, while still providing good experimental results. We evaluate our technique using a data set from Amazon.com consisting of sales data and the related consumer reviews posted over a 15-month period for 242 products. Our experimental evaluation shows that we can extract actionable business intelligence from the data and better understand the customer preferences and actions. We also show that the textual portion of the reviews can improve product sales prediction compared to a baseline technique that simply relies on numeric data.

1407;SOCIAL RANKING OF MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS BASED ON SOCIAL INFORMATION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Hanhoon Kang and Seong Joon Yoo and Dongil Han;2011;In this paper we propose a method with which to rank medical institutions by utilizing the social information provided by social network services (SNS). Furthermore, the gap between the rankings proposed in this paper and the rankings based on the existing method provided by USNews.com is analyzed, and a need for social marketing by medical institutions is proposed. USNews.com ranks medical institutions each year and publishes the data through its site. Here, the rankings are determined based on the information generated offline, based on the ranking criteria determined by a specific group, in order to provide the applicable information. Consequently, the rankings perceived by the patients who actually visit the medical institutions may be somewhat different from the rankings provided by USNews.com. For this paper the social information related to medical institutions was crawled from the SNS sites in order to rank the medical institutions based on the information generated by many users in the social media, and these rankings were compared to the ranking results provided by USNews.com. The data used for the experiment comprised the basic information on the 892 medical institutions crawled from USNews.com and the social information crawled from the SNS sites. Social information was available for only 443 institutions. The rankings were computed for these institutions based on the method proposed in this paper, so as to compare to the existing results.

While sentiment analysis on Twitter has challenges in language related issues, such as short-length message and word usage variation, it also faces the problem of unbalanced class problem.

In this paper, we aim to develop methods for ranking estates based on investment values by mining users opinions about estates from online user reviews and offline moving behaviors (e.g., Taxi traces, smart card transactions, check-ins). While a variety of features could be extracted from these data, these features are Interco related and redundant. Thus, selecting good features and integrating the feature selection into the fitting of a ranking model are essential. To this end, in this paper, we first strategically mine the fine-grained discrminative features from user reviews and moving behaviors, and then propose a probabilistic sparse pair wise ranking method for estates. Specifically, we first extract the explicit features from online user reviews which express users opinions about point of interests (POIs) near an estate. We also mine the implicit features from offline moving behaviors from multiple perspectives (e.g., Direction, volume, velocity, heterogeneity, topic, popularity, etc.). Then we learn an estate ranking predictor by combining a pair wise ranking objective and a sparsity regularization in a unified probabilistic framework. And we develop an effective solution for the optimization problem. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation with real world estate related data, and the experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of both features and the proposed model.;Data Mining (ICDM), 2014 IEEE International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;120-129;10.1109/ICDM.2014.18;1550-4786;Excluir

Unlike the traditional parse tree features which include all the attached syntactic categories to capture linguistic properties of text, the new features are solely or primarily defined based on the tree structure, and thus better reflect the pure structural properties of parse trees. We hypothesize that these new complex structural features capture an orthogonal perspective of text even compared to advanced syntactic ones. Evaluation based on three different text categorization tasks (i.e., nationality detection, essay scoring, and sentiment analysis) shows that the proposed new tree structure features complement the existing ones to enrich text representation. Experiment results further show that a combination of the proposed new structure features with word n-grams can improve F1 score and classification accuracy.;Semantic Computing (ICSC), 2013 IEEE Seventh International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;9-16;10.1109/ICSC.2013.13;NULO;Excluir
1412;STRUCTURED FEATURE EXTRACTION USING ASSOCIATION RULES;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Tian, N.a  and Xu, Y.a  and Li, Y.a  and Pasi, G.b;2013;As of today, opinion mining has been widely used to identify the strength and weakness of products (e.g., cameras) or services (e.g., services in medical clinics or hospitals) based upon peoples feedback such as user reviews. Feature extraction is a crucial step for opinion mining which has been used to collect useful information from user reviews. Most existing approaches only find individual features of a product without the structural relationships between the features which usually exists. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract features and feature relationship, represented as tree structure called a feature hierarchy, based on frequent patterns and associations between patterns derived from user reviews. The generated feature hierarchy profiles the product at multiple levels and provides more detailed information about the product. Our experiment results based on some popularly used review datasets show that the proposed feature extraction approach can identify more correct features than the baseline model. Even though the datasets used in the experiment are about cameras, our work can be applied to generate features about a service such as the services in hospitals or clinics.

1413;STRUCTURED WEB REVIEW EXTRACTION AND OPINION SUMMARIZATION;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Li, S.a  b  and Chen, Z.a  and Tang, L.a  and Hu, J.a;2009;This paper focuses on structured Web review extraction and opinion summarization. An opinion extraction framework and a feature-opinion based opinion summarization algorithm (FOOSA) are proposed. Opinion related Web pages are first clustered according to their link and title similarities. Then reviews are extracted using tag patterns which are generated through one instance learning method. The extracted reviews are filtered basically according to some rules to remove meaningless symbols. At last, all reviews are segmented into feature-opinion sentences for continual processing. In opinion summarization, FOOSA uses feature-opinion pairs as keys to construct feature-opinion (FO) buckets. Then we use inter bucket reducing method based on information entropy to remove duplicated sentences in different buckets. FOOSA also carries out intra bucket clustering to select representative sentences from every bucket. FOOSA builds positive and negative text opinion summaries through our ranking method. A structured review extraction and opinion summarization system is implemented based on our approach. Our system provides not only text opinion summarization, but also Web based graphical overall sentiment summarization. Experiments show our review extraction and opinion summarization approaches are effective and promising.

1414;STUDY ON THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE TEXT CLASSIFICATION AND PRETREATMENT OF CHINESE NETWORK TEXT;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Chao, C.a  and Jiang, W.b;2012;Subjective and objective text classification is widely used in product reviews, video reviews, social public opinion analysis and micro-blogging attitude analysis. To solve the existing problem of network text formalization in subjective and objective text classification, a machine learning classification method based on network informal language (NIL) is proposed. Firstly, a network informal dictionary is constructed by writing a web crawler to collect informal words which can be divided into two categories: typical type and fuzzy type. Then, different methods are put forward to formalize the informal network text based on the two types of informal words.

Whereas in English, Chinese, or Spanish this field has a long history and evaluation datasets for various domains are widely available, in the case of the Czech language no systematic research has yet been conducted. We tackle this issue and establish a common ground for further research by providing a large human-annotated Czech social media corpus. Furthermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods for sentiment analysis. We explore different pre-processing techniques and employ various features and classifiers. We also experiment with five different feature selection algorithms and investigate the influence of named entity recognition and preprocessing on sentiment classification performance. Moreover, in addition to our newly created social media dataset, we also report results for other popular domains, such as movie and product reviews. We believe that this article will not only extend the current sentiment analysis research to another family of languages, but will also encourage competition, potentially leading to the production of high-end commercial solutions.

1422;THE FLDA MODEL FOR ASPECT-BASED OPINION MINING: ADDRESSING THE COLD START PROBLEM;ACM;SCOPUS;Moghaddam, S. and Ester, M.;2013;Aspect-based opinion mining from online reviews has attracted a lot of attention recently. The main goal of all of the proposed methods is extracting aspects and/or estimating aspect ratings. Recent works, which are often based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), consider both tasks simultaneously. These models are normally trained at the item level, i.e., a model is learned for each item separately. Learning a model per item is fine when the item has been reviewed extensively and has enough training data. However, in reallife datasets such as those from Epinions.com and Amazon.com more than 90% of items have less than 10 reviews, so-called cold start items. State-of-the-art LDA models for aspect-based opinion mining are trained at the item level and therefore perform poorly for cold start items due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model based on LDA, called Factorized LDA (FLDA), to address the cold start problem. The underlying assumption of FLDA is that aspects and ratings of a review are influenced not only by the item but also by the reviewer. It further assumes that both items and reviewers can be modeled by a set of latent factors which represent their aspect and rating distributions. Different from state-of-the-art LDA models, FLDA is trained at the category level and learns the latent factors using the reviews of all the items of a category, in particular the non cold start items, and uses them as prior for cold start items. Our experiments on three real-life datasets demonstrate the improved effectiveness of the FLDA model in terms of likelihood of the held-out test set. We also evaluate the accuracy of FLDA based on two application-oriented measures.

1423;THE METHOD FOR A SUMMARIZATION OF PRODUCT REVIEWS USING THE USERS OPINION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Jung-Yeon Yang and Jaeseok Myung and Sang-goo Lee;2009;As the number of transactions in E-market places is growing, more and more product information and product reviews are posted on the Internet. Because customers want to purchase good products, product reviews became most important information. But, because of the massive volume of reviews, customers canpsilat read all reviews. In order to solve this problem, a lot of research is being carried out in Opinion Mining. Through the Opinion Mining, we can know about contents of whole product reviews. Traditionally research on natural language processing was applied to the opinion mining area in early stage. Recently, the computational statistics are applied to handle massive volume of reviews. In this research, we suggest a method for summarization of product reviews using the userpsilas opinion, feature occurrences, and the rate of review in order to improve the performance of existing methods. With this method, we can handle massive volumes of reviews in a short time efficiently. We guarantee the correctness of the review summary by finding out the semantic meaning of reviews. Besides, we show these advantages through some experiments.;Information, Process, and Knowledge Management, 2009. eKNOW 09.

In order to improve the customer satisfaction, many e-commerce sites provides the provision to write reviews about products. Instead of manually reading and evaluating numerous reviews, an automated procedure can be deployed to get the overall polarity of the reviews. The goal of the research is to present an approach with the target of deriving qualitative sentiment analysis. Although many techniques have been proposed by the researchers for extracting sentiments from text. This paper introduces the SAFE (sentiment analysis and feature extraction) miner, a fine grained approach for calculating the sentiment score at aspect level. Thus, developing the feature extraction matrix (FEM). FEM will help in determining the features, being commented upon. It will also help in detecting the popular features among the reviews.

Most existing approaches use a set of opinion words for the purpose. However, the semantic orientations of many words are context dependent. In this paper, we propose to use some linguistic rules to deal with the problem together with a new opinion aggregation function. Extensive experiments show that these rules and the function are highly effective.

Sentiment analysis of product reviews has recently become very popular in Web text mining, natural language processing and computational linguistics research. Automated analysis of the sentiments presented in online consumer feedbacks can facilitate both organizations business strategy development and individual consumers comparison shopping. The main contribution of this paper is the illustration of a novel feature-level sentiment analysis mechanism which is underpinned by a fuzzy domain sentiment ontology tree extraction algorithm. The proposed mechanism can automatically construct fuzzy domain ontology tree (FDSOT) based on the product reviews, including the extraction of sentiment words, product features and the relations among features.

The focus of this paper is the development of a framework on top of sentiment analysis for detecting contradictions. First, we introduce a statistical model of contradictions based on a mean value and the variance of sentiments among different posts. It can be used to analyze and track sentiment evolution over time, to identify interesting trends and patterns or even to enable argument extraction. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing contradictions on noisy data. Inspired by this model, which has proven to be effective and efficient for numeric sentiments, we are trying to generalize it for arbitrary opinion data and outline a universal framework which can be efficiently used on a large scale. We discuss various problems and challenges of such a formulation and outline the scope of our future work in this direction.;Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;1219-1222;10.1109/ICDMW.2011.167;NULO;Excluir
1406;SOCIAL NETWORKS FACEBOOK STATUTES UPDATES MINING FOR SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION;IEEE_B;IEEE;Akaichi, J.;2013;In recent years, text mining and sentiment analysis have received great attention due to the abundance of opinion data that exist in social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. Sentiments are projected on these media using texts for expressing feelings such as friendship, social support, anger, happiness, etc. Existing sentiment analysis studies tend to identify user behaviors and state of minds but remain insufficient due to complexities in conveyed texts. In this research paper, we focus on the usage of text mining for sentiment classification. Illustration is performed on Tunisian users statuses on --Facebook-- posts during the --Arabic Spring-- era. Our aim is to extract useful information, about users sentiments and behaviors during this sensitive and significant period. For that purpose, we propose a method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes.

In order to cope with the growth of such so much multimodal data, there is an urgent need to develop an intelligent multi-modal analysis framework that can effectively extract information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal information extraction agent, which infers and aggregates the semantic and affective information associated with user-generated multimodal data in contexts such as e-learning, e-health, automatic video content tagging and human-computer interaction. In particular, the developed intelligent agent adopts an ensemble feature extraction approach by exploiting the joint use of tri-modal (text, audio and video) features to enhance the multimodal information extraction process.

1431;TWITTER OPINION TOPIC MODEL: EXTRACTING PRODUCT OPINIONS FROM TWEETS BY LEVERAGING HASHTAGS AND SENTIMENT LEXICON;ACM;ACM;Lim, Kar Wai and Buntine, Wray;2014;Aspect-based opinion mining is widely applied to review data to aggregate or summarize opinions of a product, and the current state-of-the-art is achieved with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based model. Although social media data like tweets are laden with opinions, their --dirty-- nature (as natural language) has discouraged researchers from applying LDA-based opinion model for product review mining. Tweets are often informal, unstructured and lacking labeled data such as categories and ratings, making it challenging for product opinion mining. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based opinion model named Twitter Opinion Topic Model (TOTM) for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. TOTM leverages hashtags, mentions, emoticons and strong sentiment words that are present in tweets in its discovery process. It improves opinion prediction by modeling the target-opinion interaction directly, thus discovering target specific opinion words, neglected in existing approaches. Moreover, we propose a new formulation of incorporating sentiment prior information into a topic model, by utilizing an existing public sentiment lexicon. This is novel in that it learns and updates with the data. We conduct experiments on 9 million tweets on electronic products, and demonstrate the improved performance of TOTM in both quantitative evaluations and qualitative analysis. We show that aspect-based opinion analysis on massive volume of tweets provides useful opinions on products.;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management;NULO;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2661829.2662005;NULO;1319--1328;10.1145/2661829.2662005;978-1-4503-2598-1;Incluir

This study proposes a method of unsupervised product feature extraction for feature-oriented opinion determination. The domain-specific features are extracted by measuring the similarity distance of domain vectors. A domain vector is derived based on the association values between a feature and comparative domain corpora. A novel term similarity measure (PMIâ€TFIDF) is introduced to evaluate the association of candidate features and domain entities. The results show that our approach of feature extraction outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and the only external resources used are comparative domain corpora. Therefore, it is generic and unsupervised. Compared with traditional pointwise mutual information (PMI), PMIâ€TFIDF showed better distinction ability. We also propose feature-oriented opinion determination based on feature-opinion pair extraction and feature-oriented opinion lexicon generation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and indicate that feature-oriented opinion lexicons are superior to general opinion lexicons for feature-oriented opinion determination.;Information Sciences;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025514001698;272;16 - 28;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.063;0020-0255;Incluir
1434;USING AN INFORMATION QUALITY FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT REVIEWS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Tseng, Y.-D. and Chen, C.C.;2009;The prevalence of Web2.0 makes the Web an invaluable source of information. For instance, product reviews composed collaboratively by many independent Internet reviewers can help consumers make purchase decisions and enable manufactures to improve their business strategies. As the number of reviews is increasing exponentially, opinion mining is needed to identify important reviews and opinions for users. Most opinion mining approaches try to extract sentimental or bipolar expressions from a large volume of reviews. However, the mining process often ignores the quality of each review and may retrieve useless or even noisy reviews. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the quality of information in product reviews. We treat review quality evaluation as a classification problem and employ an effective information quality framework to extract representative review features. Experiments based on an expert-composed data corpus demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly.

A novel SOM display named Â¿Attribute Accumulative MatrixÂ¿ is presented. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, 22157 restaurant reviews are collected and product features of catering industry are identified. The experiment results show that this approach can effectively identify the product features.;Natural Computation, 2009. ICNC 09.

1440;VISUAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER FEEDBACK STREAMS USING GEO-TEMPORAL TERM ASSOCIATIONS;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Hao, M.C.a  and Rohrdantz, C.b  and Janetzko, H.b  and Keim, D.A.b  and Dayal, U.a  and Haug, L.a  and Hsu, M.a  and Stoffel, F.b;2013;Large manufacturing companies frequently receive thousands of web surveys every day. People share their thoughts regarding a wide range of products, their features, and the service they received. In addition, more than 190 million tweets (small text Web posts) are generated daily. Both survey feedback and tweets are underutilized as a source for understanding customer sentiments. To explore high-volume customer feedback streams, in this article, we introduce four time series visual analysis techniques: (1) feature-based sentiment analysis that extracts, measures, and maps customer feedback:, (2) a novel way of determining term associations that identify attributes, verbs, and adjectives frequently occurring together:, (3) a self-organizing term association map and a pixel cell-based sentiment calendar to identify co-occurring and influential opinion:, and (4) a new geo-based term association technique providing a key term geo map to enable the user to inspect the statistical significance and the sentiment distribution of individual key terms. We have used and evaluated these techniques and combined them into a well-fitted solution for an effective analysis of large customer feedback streams such as web surveys (from product buyers) and Twitter (e.g. from Kung-Fu Panda movie reviewers).

1441;WEAKNESS FINDER: FIND PRODUCT WEAKNESS FROM CHINESE REVIEWS BY USING ASPECTS BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS;SCIENCE_DIRECT;SCIENCE_DIRECT;Wenhao Zhang and Hua Xu and Wei Wan;2012;Finding the weakness of the products from the customersâ€™ feedback can help manufacturers improve their product quality and competitive strength. In recent years, more and more people express their opinions about products online, and both the feedback of manufacturersâ€™ products or their competitorsâ€™ products could be easily collected. However, itâ€™s impossible for manufacturers to read every review to analyze the weakness of their products. Therefore, finding product weakness from online reviews becomes a meaningful work. In this paper, we introduce such an expert system, Weakness Finder, which can help manufacturers find their product weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure, and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customersâ€™ reviews, or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitorâ€™s product reviews. Weakness Finder has been used to help a body wash manufacturer find their product weakness, and our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the Weakness Finder.;Expert Systems with Applications;NULO;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417412004290;39;10283 - 10291;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.166;0957-4174;Excluir
1442;WILL I LIKE IT? PROVIDING PRODUCT OVERVIEWS BASED ON OPINION EXCERPTS;IEEE_B;IEEE;Homoceanu, S. and Loster, M. and Lofi, C. and Balke, W.-T.;2011;With the growing popularity and acceptance of e-commerce platforms, users face an ever increasing burden in actually choosing the right product from the plethora of online offers. Thus, techniques for personalization and shopping assistance are in high demand by users, as well as by shopping platforms themselves. For a pleasant and successful shopping experience, users should be empowered to easily decide on which products to buy with high confidence. However, especially for entertainment goods like e.g. movies, books, or music, this task is very challenging. Unfortunately, to days approaches for dealing with this challenge (like e.g. recommender systems) suffer severe drawbacks: recommender systems are completely opaque, i.e. the recommendation is hard to justify semantically. User reviews could help users to form an opinion of recommended items, but with several thousand reviews available for e.g. a given popular movie, it is very challenging for users to find representative reviews. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for automatically analyzing user reviews using advanced opinion mining techniques. The results of this analysis are then used to group reviews by their semantics, i.e. by their contained opinions and point-of-views. Furthermore, the relevant paragraphs with respect to each opinion is extracted and presented to the user. These extracts can easily be digested by users to allow them a quick and diverse forming of opinion, and thus increasing their confidence in their decision, and their overall customer satisfaction.;Commerce and Enterprise Computing (CEC), 2011 IEEE 13th Conference on;NULO;NULO;NULO;26-33;10.1109/CEC.2011.12;NULO;Excluir
1443;WORD CLASSIFICATION FOR SENTIMENT POLARITY ESTIMATION USING NEURAL NETWORK;SCOPUS;SCOPUS;Yanagimoto, H. and Shimada, M. and Yoshimura, A.;2013;Though there are many digitalized documents in the Internet, the almost all documents are unlabeled data. Hence, using such numerous unlabeled data, a classifier has to be construct. In pattern recognition research field many researchers pay attention to a deep architecture neural network to achieve the previous aim. The deep architecture neural network is one of semi-supervised learning approaches and achieve high performance in an object recognition task. The network is trained with many unlabeled data and transform input raw features into new features that represent higher concept, for example a human face. In this study I pay attention to feature generation ability of a deep architecture neural network and apply it to natural language processing. Concretely word clustering is developed for sentiment analysis. Experimental results shows clustering performance is good regardless of an unsupervised learning approach.

1444;YOUTUBE MOVIE REVIEWS: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN AN AUDIO-VISUAL CONTEXT;IEEE_B;IEEE;Wollmer, M. and Weninger, F. and Knaup, T. and Schuller, B. and Congkai Sun and Sagae, K. and Morency, L.-P.;2013;This work focuses on automatically analyzing a speakers sentiment in online videos containing movie reviews. In addition to textual information, this approach considers adding audio features as typically used in speech-based emotion recognition as well as video features encoding valuable valence information conveyed by the speaker. Experimental results indicate that training on written movie reviews is a promising alternative to exclusively using (spoken) in-domain data for building a system that analyzes spoken movie review videos, and that language-independent audio-visual analysis can compete with linguistic analysis.;Intelligent Systems, IEEE;NULO;NULO;28;46-53;10.1109/MIS.2013.34;1541-1672;Excluir
