15081;"Dynamic semantic textual document clustering using frequent terms and named entity";0;"Yafooz, W.M.S. and Abidin, S.Z.Z. and Omar, N. and Halim, R.A.";"Data is mostly stored in digital format rather than hard copy because the former is safer, more secure, smaller in size, and faster to retrieve than the latter. With the increasing number of electronic documents to be organized for users to obtain knowledge and integrate information, document clustering has been applied by grouping textual documents based on their similarities. Many attempts have been made to perform textual document clustering with highly accurate results (i.e., close to nature classes) and high processing performance. However, such proposed techniques work in batch (or static) mode in which performance tend to be sacrificed with the use of all the terms in the document, at times resulting in overlapping or scalability issues. Few studies that focus on dynamic clustering also reported on performance issues. This paper contributes in the investigation of textual document clustering approaches and highlights the importance of using dynamic clustering in mining frequent terms with included named entity. This method is used to achieve high efficiency and high-quality data clustering. The method is also beneficial to be used in textual document clustering algorithms for many text domain applications.

15082;"Text clustering using statistical and semantic data";0;"Benghabrit, A.a  and Ouhbi, B.a  and Behja, H.a  and Frikh, B.b ";"The explosive growth of information stored in unstructured texts created a great demand for new and powerful tools to acquire useful information, such as text mining. Document clustering is one of its the powerful methods and by which document retrieval, organization and summarization can be achieved. However, it represents a challenge when dealing with a big number of data due to high dimensionality of the feature space and to the semantic correlation between features. In this paper, we propose a new sequential document clustering algorithm that uses a statistical and semantic feature selection methods. The semantic process was proposed to improve the frequency mechanism with the semantic relations of the text documents. The proposed algorithm selects iteratively relevant features and performs clustering until convergence. To evaluate its performance, experiments on two corpora have been conducted. The obtained results show that the performance of our algorithm is superior to that obtained by the existing algorithms.

15092;"Enhanced cross-domain document clustering with a semantically enhanced text stemmer (SETS)";0;"Stankov, I. and Todorov, D. and Setchi, R.";"The aim of document clustering is to produce coherent clusters of similar documents. Clustering algorithms rely on text normalisation techniques to represent and cluster documents. Although most document clustering algorithms perform well in specific knowledge domains, processing cross-domain document repositories is still a challenge. This paper attempts to address this challenge. It investigates the performance of the sk-means clustering algorithm across domains, by comparing the cluster coherence produced with semantic-based and traditional (TF-IDF-based) document representations. The evaluation is conducted on 20 different generic sub-domains of a thousand documents, each randomly selected from the Reuters21578 corpus. The experimental results obtained from the evaluation demonstrate improved coherence of clusters produced by using a semantically enhanced text stemmer (SETS), when compared to the text normalisation obtained with the Porter stemmer. In addition, semantic-based text normalisation is shown to be resistant to noise, which is often introduced in the index aggregation stage, a stage that acquires features to represent documents.

This study uses the latent semantic analysis algorithm to obtain the semantic relations between words, and establishes the semantic dictionary by ESD, then we use the word set as features to express text features, and form TCSD combining with the clustering algorithm to cluster the corpus. The experimental results show that the precision rate is 94.29% and the recall rate is 94.28%, which indicate that TCSD performs better than the algorithms that use words as features.

More specifically, we consider how to build a system that could be used for searching stories that relate to the interest of the user (content relevance), and help the user in his or her developmental process by providing encouragement, useful experiences, or otherwise supportive content (emotive relevance). The first objective is covered through topic modeling applying independent component analysis and the second by using sentiment analysis. We also use style analysis to exclude stories that are inappropriate in style. We discuss linguistic theories and methodological aspects of this area, outline a hybrid methodology that can be used in selecting stories that match both the content and emotive criteria, and present the results of experiments that have been used to validate the approach.

15105;"Refined semantic kernel matching pursuit for fast text classification";0;"Zhang, Q. and Zhang, Z. and Wang, L.";"Kernel-based learning algorithms have been proven successful and powerful in many different tasks. However, directly applying them to text classification (TC) field will suffer inherent semantic ambiguity and prohibitive computational costs, which obstruct their practical use in large scale and real time applications with fast testing requirement. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a refined semantic kernel matching pursuit (KMP) approach for fast TC. This approach firstly introduces latent semantic kernel as a new type of dictionary function to KMP, which can deal with high dimensionality, sparsity and ambiguity suffered in text. Moreover, taking the practical issue of data distribution drift with time changing into account, we further propose a method for constructing refined semantic dictionary via concept factorization, which can maintain the updated representative samples in the limited storage to be utilized for various model updating schemes in future. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method can significantly improve the computational efficiency in predicating phase while preserving considerable performance.

However, vast majority of these studies are applied to English texts and to the date there are no similar studies on classification of Turkish documents. We empirically analyze the effect of using Turkish Wikipedia (Vikipedi) as a semantic resource in classification of Turkish documents.

The conversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars for biofuels production requires the use of enzyme cocktails that can efficiently and economically hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass. As many fungi naturally break down lignocellulose, the identification and characterization of the enzymes involved is a key challenge in the research and development of biomass-derived products and fuels. One approach to meeting this challenge is to mine the rapidly-expanding repertoire of microbial genomes for enzymes with the appropriate catalytic properties. Results: Semantic technologies, including natural language processing, ontologies, semantic Web services and Web-based collaboration tools, promise to support users in handling complex data, thereby facilitating knowledge-intensive tasks. An ongoing challenge is to select the appropriate technologies and combine them in a coherent system that brings measurable improvements to the users. We present our ongoing development of a semantic infrastructure in support of genomics-based lignocellulose research. Part of this effort is the automated curation of knowledge from information on fungal enzymes that is available in the literature and genome resources. Conclusions: Working closely with fungal biology researchers who manually curate the existing literature, we developed ontological natural language processing pipelines integrated in a Web-based interface to assist them in two main tasks: mining the literature for relevant knowledge, and at the same time providing rich and semantically linked information.

15118;"A framework of Chinese semantic text mining based on ontology learning";0;"Zhang, Y.-F.a  and Hu, F.a  b ";"Text mining and ontology learning can be effectively employed to acquire the Chinese semantic information. This paper explores a framework of semantic text mining based on ontology learning to find the potential semantic knowledge from the immensity text information on the Internet. This framework consists of four parts: Data Acquisition, Feature Extraction, Ontology Construction, and Text Knowledge Pattern Discovery. Then the framework is applied into an actual case to try to find out the valuable information, and even to assist the consumers with selecting proper products. The results show that this framework is reasonable and effective.

In this paper, we present a novel non-parametric feature selection method based on sparse representation in text classification.

Motivated by the fact that kernel trick can capture the nonlinear similarity of features, which may reduce the feature quantization error, we propose Empirical Kernel Sparse Representation (EKSR). We apply EKSR to reconstruct weight vector between samples, then design evaluating mechanism CKernel Sparsity Score (KSS) to select excellent feature subset. As the natural discriminative power of EKSR, KSS can find Agood@ feature which preserves the original structure with less information loss.

15121;"Text document clustering using semantic neighbors";0;"Danesh, M. and Shirgahi, H.";"Data clustering is a powerful technique for discovering knowledge from textual documents. In this field, K-means family algorithms have many applications because of simplicity and high speed in clustering of large scale data. In these algorithms, the criterion of cosine similarity only measures the pairwise similarity of documents that it doesnt have fine operation whenever the clusters are not properly separated. On the contrary, the concepts of Neighbors and Link with the spot of general information in calculating of closeness rate of two documents, in addition to pairwise similarity between them, have better operation. In this model, semantic relations between words have been ignored and only documents with the same terms have been clustered together. This study uses WordNet Ontology for making new model of documents representation that semantic relations between words for reweighing words frequency in documents vector space model, have been used and then Neighbors and Link concepts applied to this model. Results of using the proposed method (Semantic Neighbors) on real-world text data show better operation than previous methods and more efficient in text document clustering.

15128;"Efficient semantic kernel-based text classification using matching pursuit KFDA";0;"Zhang, Q.a  and Li, J.b  and Zhang, Z.a ";"A number of powerful kernel-based learning machines, such as support vector machines (SVMs), kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA), have been proposed with competitive performance. However, directly applying existing attractive kernel approaches to text classification (TC) task will suffer semantic related information deficiency and incur huge computation costs hindering their practical use in numerous large scale and real-time applications with fast testing requirement. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel semantic kernel-based framework for efficient TC which offers a sparse representation of the final optimal prediction function while preserving the semantic related information in kernel approximate subspace. Experiments on 20-Newsgroup dataset demonstrate the proposed method compared with SVM and KNN (K-nearest neighbor) can significantly reduce the computation costs in predicating phase while maintaining considerable classification accuracy.

15131;"A knowledge-based semantic kernel for text classification";0;"Nasir, J.A.a  and Karim, A.a  and Tsatsaronis, G.b  and Varlamis, I.c ";"Typically, in textual document classification the documents are represented in the vector space using the ""Bag of Words"" (BOW) approach. Despite its ease of use, BOW representation cannot handle word synonymy and polysemy problems and does not consider semantic relatedness between words. In this paper, we overcome the shortages of the BOW approach by embedding a known WordNet-based semantic relatedness measure for pairs of words, namely Omiotis, into a semantic kernel. The suggested measure incorporates the TF-IDF weighting scheme, thus creating a semantic kernel which combines both semantic and statistical information from text. Empirical evaluation with real data sets demonstrates that our approach successfully achieves improved classification accuracy with respect to the standard BOW representation, when Omiotis is embedded in four different classifiers.

Text documents are transformed to hierarchical document-graphs, and an efficient graph-mining technique is used to find frequent subgraphs. Discovered frequent subgraphs are then utilized to generate accurate sense-based document clusters.

15139;"A Survey of Computational Semantics: Representation, Inference and Knowledge in Wide-Coverage Text Understanding";0;"Bos, J.";"The aim of computational semantics is to capture the meaning of natural language expressions in representations suitable for performing inferences, in the service of understanding human language in written or spoken form. First-order logic is a good starting point, both from the representation and inference point of view. But even if one makes the choice of first-order logic as representation language, this is not enough: the computational semanticist needs to make further decisions on how to model events, tense, modal contexts, anaphora and plural entities. Semantic representations are usually built on top of a syntactic analysis, using unification, techniques from the lambda-calculus or linear logic, to do the book-keeping of variable naming. Inference has many potential applications in computational semantics. One way to implement inference is using algorithms from automated deduction dedicated to first-order logic, such as theorem proving and model building. Theorem proving can help in finding contradictions or checking for new information. Finite model building can be seen as a complementary inference task to theorem proving, and it often makes sense to use both procedures in parallel. The models produced by model generators for texts not only show that the text is contradiction-free; they also can be used for disambiguation tasks and linking interpretation with the real world. To make interesting inferences, often additional background knowledge is required (not expressed in the analysed text or speech parts). This can be derived (and turned into first-order logic) from raw text, semi-structured databases or large-scale lexical databases such as WordNet. Promising future research directions of computational semantics are investigating alternative representation and inference methods (using weaker variants of first-order logic, reasoning with defaults), and developing evaluation methods measuring the semantic adequacy of systems and formalisms.

15140;"Supervised semantic relation mining from Linguistically noisy text documents";0;"Giannone, C.a  b  and Basili, R.b  and Naggar, P.a  and Moschitti, A.c ";"In this paper, we present models for mining text relations between named entities, which can deal with data highly affected by linguistic noise. Our models are made robust by: (a) the exploitation of state-of-the-art statistical algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) along with effective and versatile pattern mining methods, e. g. word sequence kernels; (b) the design of specific features capable of capturing long distance relationships; and (c) the use of domain prior knowledge in the form of ontological constraints, e. g. bounds on the type of relation arguments given by the semantic categories of the involved entities. This property allows for keeping small the training data required by SVMs and consequently lowering the system design costs. We empirically tested our hybrid model in the very complex domain of business intelligence, where the textual data are constituted by reports on investigations into criminal enterprises based on police interrogatory reports, electronic eavesdropping and wiretaps. The target relations are typically established between entities, as they are mentioned in these information sources. The experiments on mining such relations show that our approach with small training data is robust to non-conventional languages as dialects, jargon expressions or coded words typically contained in such text.

15142;"Enhancing text representation for classification tasks with semantic graph structures";0;"Wu, J. and Xuan, Z. and Pan, D.";"To represent the textual knowledge more expressively, a kind of semantic-based graph structure is proposed, in which more semantic and ordering information among terms as well as the structural information of the text are incorporated. Such model can be constructed by extracting representative terms from texts and their mutually semantic relationships. Afterward, it is represented as a graph, whose nodes are the selected terms and whose edges are the corresponding relationships respectively. Moreover, the weight is assigned to each edge so that the strength of relationship between two terms can be measured. Furthermore, for this weighted directed graph structure, a novel graph similarity algorithm is developed by extracting the maximum common subgraph between two concerned graphs, which can therefore be used to measure the distance between two graph structures, i.e., two texts, and further be applied to classification tasks. Finally, some experiments have been conducted with the Chinese benchmark corpus for validation. The experimental results have proved the better performance of the proposed textual knowledge representation model in terms of its precision and recall.

15150;"Enhancing GSOM text clustering with Latent Semantic Analysis";0;"Matharage, S. and Alahakoon, D.";"Growing Self Organizing Map (GSOM) has proven benefits in text clustering. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) also has been used in text clustering to capture the latent concepts from text. This paper presents a novel combination of GSOM and LSA to improve text clustering results compared to using GSOM on its own. LSA is an inherently global algorithm that looks at trends and patterns globally and GSOM is a nearest neighborhood based algorithm which looks at local patterns. Combination of these two can be used to discover both the global and local patterns. In the proposed model, initial text corpus is converted into its vector space representation using the traditional Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. Then the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) followed by Frobenius norm is applied on the resulting high dimensional vector to come up with a new vector with an optimal number of dimensions. Experiments using the proposed model were conducted and compared with the original GSOM under the same conditions. Experiment results demonstrate that the new combination of these well known techniques enhances the accuracy of clustering results and the computational time than the GSOM alone.

15153;"Semantic enrichment of text representation with wikipedia for text classification";0;"Yamakawa, H. and Peng, J. and Feldman, A.";"Text classification is a widely studied topic in the area of machine learning. A number of techniques have been developed to represent and classify text documents. Most of the techniques try to achieve good classification performance while taking a document only by its words (e.g. statistical analysis on word frequency and distribution patterns). One of the recent trends in text classification research is to incorporate more semantic interpretation in text classification, especially by using Wikipedia. This paper introduces a technique for incorporating the vast amount of human knowledge accumulated in Wikipedia into text representation and classification. The aim is to improve classification performance by transforming general terms into a set of related concepts grouped around semantic themes. In order to achieve this goal, this paper proposes a unique method for breaking the enormous amount of extracted Wikipedia knowledge (concepts) into smaller pieces (subsets of concepts). The subsets of concepts are separately used to represent the same set of documents in a number of different ways, from which an ensemble of classifiers is built. Experimental results show that an ensemble of classifiers individually trained on a different representation of the document set performs better with increased accuracy and stability than that of a classifier trained only on the original document set.

In this paper, we propose a semantics-based model to represent text data in two levels. One level is for syntactic information and the other is for semantic information. Syntactic level represents each document as a term vector, and the component records tf-idf value of each term. The semantic level represents document with Wikipedia concepts related to terms in syntactic level. The syntactic and semantic information are efficiently combined by our proposed multi-layer classification framework. Experimental results on benchmark dataset (Reuters-21578) have shown that the proposed representation model plus proposed classification framework improves the performance of text classification by comparing with the flat text representation models (term VSM, concept VSM, term+concept VSM) plus existing classification methods.

Its a common agreement that more sufficient text semantic meaning be adopted in text representation to deal with the challenge. This paper introduces semantic meaning of coreference in and to improve traditional BOW representation. The result of text classification experiment shows that, contrasted with traditional BOW representation, the improved model increases the discernment to positive instances.

15164;"Extract semantic information from WordNet to improve text classification performance";0;"Bai, R. and Wang, X. and Liao, J.";"Since a decade, text categorization has become an active field of research in the machine learning community. Most of the approaches are based on the term occurrence frequency. The performance of such surface-based methods can decrease when the texts are too complex, i.e., ambiguous. One alternative is to use the semantic-based approaches to process textual documents according to their meaning. In this paper, we propose a Concept-based Vector Space Model which reflects the more abstract version of the semantic information instead of the Vector Space Model for the text. This model adjusts the weight of the Vector Space by importing the hypernymy-hyponymy relation between synonymy sets and the Concept Chain in the WordNet. Experimental results on several data sets show that the proposed approach, conception built from Wordnet, can achieve significant improvements with respect to the baseline algorithm.

To maximize its potential, the knowledge encoded in the text should be translated to some semantic representation such as entities and relations, which could be analyzed by machines. But large-scale practical systems for this purpose are rare. We present BeeSpace question/answering (BSQA) system that performs integrated text mining for insect biology, covering diverse aspects from molecular interactions of genes to insect behavior. BSQA recognizes a number of entities and relations in Medline documents about the model insect, Drosophila melanogaster. For any text query, BSQA exploits entity annotation of retrieved documents to identify important concepts in different categories. By utilizing the extracted relations, BSQA is also able to answer many biologically motivated questions, from simple ones such as, which anatomical part is a gene expressed in, to more complex ones involving multiple types of relations.

15168;"Exploring the feasibility and accuracy of Latent Semantic Analysis based text mining techniques to detect similarity between patent documents and scientific publications";0;"Magerman, T.a  b  and van Looy, B.a  b  c  and Song, X.a  b ";"In this study, we examine and validate the use of existing text mining techniques (based on the vector space model and latent semantic indexing) to detect similarities between patent documents and scientific publications. Clearly, experts involved in domain studies would benefit from techniques that allow similarity to be detected-and hence facilitate mapping, categorization and classification efforts. In addition, given current debates on the relevance and appropriateness of academic patenting, the ability to assess content-relatedness between sets of documents-in this case, patents and publications-might become relevant and useful. We list several options available to arrive at content based similarity measures. Different options of a vector space model and latent semantic indexing approach have been selected and applied to the publications and patents of a sample of academic inventors (n = 6). We also validated the outcomes by using independently obtained validation scores of human raters. While we conclude that text mining techniques can be valuable for detecting similarities between patents and publications, our findings also indicate that the various options available to arrive at similarity measures vary considerably in terms of accuracy: some generally accepted text mining options, like dimensionality reduction and LSA, do not yield the best results when working with smaller document sets.

The system is based on semantic indexing providing, for each set of retrieved documents, a network that links documents and relevant terms obtained by the annotation of biological entities (e.g. genes or proteins). This network provides distinct user perspectives and allows navigation over documents with similar terms and is also used to assess document relevance. A network learning procedure, based on previous work from e-mail spam filtering, is proposed, receiving as input a training set of manually classified documents.

15180;"Exploiting internal and external semantics for the clustering of short texts using world knowledge";0;"Hu, X.a  b  and Sun, N.b  and Zhang, C.b  and Chua, T.-S.b ";"Clustering of short texts, such as snippets, presents great challenges in existing aggregated search techniques due to the problem of data sparseness and the complex semantics of natural language. As short texts do not provide sufficient term occurring information, traditional text representation methods, such as bag of words"" model, have several limitations when directly applied to short texts tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve the performance of short texts clustering by exploiting the internal semantics from original text and external concepts from world knowledge. The proposed method employs a hierarchical three-level structure to tackle the data sparsity problem of original short texts and reconstruct the corresponding feature space with the integration of multiple semantic knowledge bases - Wikipedia and WordNet. Empirical evaluation with Reuters and real web dataset demonstrates that our approach is able to achieve significant improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

15183;"New semantic similarity based model for text clustering using extended gloss overlaps";0;"Gad, W.K. and Kamel, M.S.";"Most text clustering techniques are based on words and/or phrases weights in the text. Such representation is often unsatisfactory because it ignores the relationships between terms, and considers them as independent features. In this paper, a new semantic similarity based model (SSBM) is proposed. The semantic similarity based model computes semantic similarities by utilizing WordNet as an ontology. The proposed model captures the semantic similarities between documents that contain semantically similar terms but unnecessarily syntactically identical. The semantic similarity based model assigns a new weight to document terms reflecting the semantic relationships between terms that co-occur literally in the document. Our model in conjunction with the extended gloss overlaps measure and the adapted Lesk algorithm solves ambiguity, synonymy problems that are not detected using traditional term frequency based text mining techniques. The proposed model is evaluated on the Reuters-21578 and the 20-Newsgroups text collections datasets. The performance is assessed in terms of the Fmeasure, Purity and Entropy quality measures. The obtained results show promising performance improvements compared to the traditional term based vector space model (VSM) as well as other existing methods that include semantic similarity measures in text clustering.

15190;"Semantic clustering for a functional text classification task";0;"Lippincott, T. and Passonneau, R.";"We describe a semantic clustering method designed to address shortcomings in the common bag-of-words document representation for functional semantic classification tasks. The method uses WordNet-based distance metrics to construct a similarity matrix, and expectation maximization to find and represent clusters of semantically related terms. Using these clusters as features for machine learning helps maintain performance across distinct, domain-specific vocabularies while reducing the size of the document representation. We present promising results along these lines, and evaluate several algorithms and parameters that influence machine learning performance. We discuss limitations of the study and future work for optimizing and evaluating the method.

15195;"Real-time enterprise ontology evolution to aid effective clinical telemedicine with text mining and automatic semantic aliasing support";0;"Wong, J.H.K. and Lin, W.W.K. and Wong, A.K.Y.";"A novel approach is proposed in this paper to aid real-time enterprise ontology evolution in a continuous fashion. Automatic semantic aliasing (ASA) and text mining (TM) are the two collaborating mechanisms (together known as ASA&TM) that support this approach. The text miner finds new knowledge items from open sources (e.g. the web or given repertoires), and the ASA mechanism associates all the canonical knowledge items in the ontology and those found by text mining via their degrees of similarity. Real-time enterprise ontology evolution makes the host system increasingly smarter because it keeps the host systems ontological knowledge abreast of the contemporary advances. The ASA&TM approach was verified in the Nongs mobile clinics based pervasive TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) clinical telemedicine environment. All the experimental results unanimously indicate that the proposed approach is definitively effective for the designated purpose.

15197;"Enhancing text clustering by leveraging wikipedia semantics";0;"Hu, J.a  and Fang, L.c  and Cao, Y.b  and Zeng, H.-J.a  and Li, H.a  and Yang, Q.d  and Chen, Z.a ";"Most traditional text clustering methods are based on ""bag of words"" (BOW) representation based on frequency statistics in a set of documents. BOW, however, ignores the important information on the semantic relationships between key terms. To overcome this problem, several methods have been proposed to enrich text representation with external resource in the past, such as WordNet. However, many of these approaches suffer from some limitations: 1) WordNet has limited coverage and has a lack of effective word-sense disambiguation ability; 2) Most of the text representation enrichment strategies, which append or replace document terms with their hypernym and synonym, are overly simple. In this paper, to overcome these deficiencies, we first propose a way to build a concept thesaurus based on the semantic relations (synonym, hypernym, and associative relation) extracted from Wikipedia. Then, we develop a unified framework to leverage these semantic relations in order to enhance traditional content similarity measure for text clustering. The experimental results on Reuters and OHSUMED datasets show that with the help of Wikipedia thesaurus, the clustering performance of our method is improved as compared to previous methods. In addition, with the optimized weights for hypernym, synonym, and associative concepts that are tuned with the help of a few labeled data users provided, the clustering performance can be further improved.

15199;"Building semantic kernels for text classification using wikipedia";0;"Wang, P. and Domeniconi, C.";"Document classification presents difficult challenges due to the sparsity and the high dimensionality of text data, and to the complex semantics of the natural language. The traditional document representation is a word-based vector (Bag of Words, or BOW), where each dimension is associated with a term of the dictionary containing all the words that appear in the corpus. Although simple and commonly used, this representation has several limitations. It is essential to embed semantic information and conceptual patterns in order to enhance the prediction capabilities of classification algorithms. In this paper, we overcome the shortages of the BOW approach by embedding background knowledge derived from Wikipedia into a semantic kernel, which is then used to enrich the representation of documents. Our empirical evaluation with real data sets demonstrates that our approach successfully achieves improved classification accuracy with respect to the BOW technique, and to other recently developed methods.

It covers huge number of concepts of various fields such as Arts, Geography, History, Science, Sports and Games. Since it is becoming a database storing all human knowledge, Wikipedia mining is a promising approach that bridges the Semantic Web and the Social Web (a. k. a. Web 2.0). In fact, in the previous researches on Wikipedia mining, it is strongly proved that Wikipedia has a remarkable capability as a corpus for knowledge extraction, especially for relatedness measurement among concepts. However, semantic relatedness is just a numerical strength of a relation but does not have an explicit relation type. To extract inferable semantic relations with explicit relation types, we need to analyze not only the link structure but also texts in Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose a consistent approach of semantic relation extraction from Wikipedia. The method consists of three sub-processes highly optimized for Wikipedia mining; 1) fast preprocessing, 2) POS (Part Of Speech) tag tree analysis, and 3) mainstay extraction.

A genetic algorithm-based clustering technique, named GA clustering, in conjunction with ontology is proposed in this article to overcome this problem. In general, the ontology measures can be partitioned into two categories: thesaurus-based methods and corpus-based methods. We take advantage of the hierarchical structure and the broad coverage taxonomy of Wordnet as the thesaurus-based ontology. However, the corpus-based method is rather complicated to handle in practical application. We propose a transformed latent semantic analysis (LSA) model as the corpus-based method in this paper. Moreover, two hybrid strategies, the combinations of the various similarity measures, are implemented in the clustering experiments. The results show that our GA clustering algorithm, in conjunction with the thesaurus based and the LSA-based method, apparently outperforms that with other similarity measures. Moreover, the superiority of the GA clustering algorithm proposed over the commonly used k-means algorithm and the standard GA is demonstrated by the improvements of the clustering performance.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";31;"2008";"2008 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering, NLP-KE 2008";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-67650351509&partnerID=40&md5=54c3249c6310200532d838e9a2afd3c2";;;;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"16/05/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"null";"null";"null";"Wordnet";"null";"agrupamento";"null";"algoritmos geneticos, LSA";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

Traditional document representation approaches typically adopt a popular bag-of-word method as the underlying document representation. Although its a simple and efficient method, the major shortcoming of bag-of-word representation is in the independent of word feature assumption. Many researchers have attempted to address this issue by incorporating semantic information into document representation. In this paper, we study the effect of semantic representation on the effectiveness of text classification systems. We employed a novel semantic smoothing technique to derive semantic information in a form of mapping probability between topic signatures and single-word features. Two classifiers, NaÃ¯ve Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were selected to carry out the classification experiments. Overall, our topic-signature semantic representation approaches significantly outperformed traditional bag-of-word representation in most datasets.

15213;"Extracting semantic networks from text via relational clustering";0;"Kok, S. and Domingos, P.";"Extracting knowledge from text has long been a goal of AI. Initial approaches were purely logical and brittle. More recently, the availability of large quantities of text on the Web has led to the development of machine learning approaches. However, to date these have mainly extracted ground facts, as opposed to general knowledge. Other learning approaches can extract logical forms, but require supervision and do not scale. In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to extracting semantic networks from large volumes of text. We use the TextRunner system [1] to extract tuples from text, and then induce general concepts and relations from them by jointly clustering the objects and relational strings in the tuples. Our approach is defined in Markov logic using four simple rules. Experiments on a dataset of two million tuples show that it outperforms three other relational clustering approaches, and extracts meaningful semantic networks.

Firstly, we exploit LSI to represent documents as vectors in a latent semantic space since we propose that the documents and their semantic relationships can be reflected more pertinently in this latent semantic space. Then, a graph needed by SGT is constructed. In the graph, a node corresponds to a vector from LSI. Finally, we apply the graph to Spectral Graph Transducer for text classification.

15216;"Semantic smoothing for bayesian text classification with small training data";0;"Zhou, X. and Zhang, X. and Hu, X.";"Bayesian text classifiers face a common issue which is referred to as data sparsity problem, especially when the size of training data is very small. The frequently used Laplacian smoothing and corpus-based background smoothing are not effective in handling it. Instead, we propose a novel semantic smoothing method to address the sparse problem. Our method extracts explicit topic signatures (e.g. words, multiword phrases, and ontology-based concepts) from a document and then statistically maps them into single-word features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three testing collections (OHSUMED, LATimes, and 20NG) to compare semantic smoothing with other approaches. When the size of training documents is small, the bayesian classifier with semantic smoothing not only outperforms the classifiers with background smoothing and Laplacian smoothing, but also beats the state-of-the-art active learning classifiers and SVM classifiers. In this paper, we also compare three types of topic signatures with respect to their effectiveness and efficiency for semantic smoothing.

15219;"Local semantic indexing based on partial least squares for text classification";0;"Zeng, X.a  c  and Li, G.a  and Wang, M.b  and Wu, G.a ";"Semantic Indexing based on Partial Least Squares (SIPLS) is an effective feature extraction method for text classification. SIPLS integrates the global category information Y with the document-class matrix X to create the latent semantic spaces. However, the global latent space may not be the optimal one for each class. To solve this problem, the Local SIPLS (LSIPLS) method is proposed which creates one SIPLS space for each class. Without the influence of global information, the local discriminative components are convenient to be extracted in LSIPLS.

15221;"Methods for augmenting semantic models with structural information for text classification";0;"Fishbein, J.M.a  and Eliasmith, C.a  b ";"Current representation schemes for automatic text classification treat documents as syntactically unstructured collections of words or concepts. Past attempts to encode syntactic structure have treated part-of-speech information as another word-like feature, but have been shown to be less effective than non-structural approaches. Here, we investigate three methods to augment semantic modelling with syntactic structure, which encode the structure across all features of the document vector while preserving text semantics. We present classification results for these methods versus the Bag-of-Concepts semantic modelling representation to determine which method best improves classification scores.

15223;"Combined syntactic and semantic kernels for text classification";0;"Bloehdorn, S.a  and Moschitti, A.b ";"The exploitation of syntactic structures and semantic background knowledge has always been an appealing subject in the context of text retrieval and information management. The usefulness of this kind of information has been shown most prominently in highly specialized tasks, such as classification in Question Answering (QA) scenarios. So far, however, additional syntactic or semantic information has been used only individually. In this paper, we propose a principled approach for jointly exploiting both types of information. We propose a new type of kernel, the Semantic Syntactic Tree Kernel (SSTK), which incorporates linguistic structures, e.g. syntactic dependencies, and semantic background knowledge, e.g. term similarity based on WordNet, to automatically learn question categories in QA. We show the power of this approach in a series of experiments with a well known Question Classification dataset.

15224;"Semantic text classification of emergent disease reports";0;"Zhang, Y. and Liu, B.";"Traditional text classification studied in the information retrieval and machine learning literature is mainly based on topics. That is, each class represents a particular topic, e.g., sports and politics. However, many real-world problems require more refined classification based on some semantic perspectives. For example, in a set of sentences about a disease, some may report outbreaks of the disease, some may describe how to cure the disease, and yet some may discuss how to prevent the disease. To classify sentences at this semantic level, the traditional bag-of-words model is no longer sufficient. In this paper, we study semantic sentence classification of disease reporting. We show that both keywords and sentence semantic features are useful. Our results demonstrated that this integrated approach is highly effective.

15229;"Compositionality in quantitative semantics. A theoretical perspective on text mining";0;"Mehler, A.";"This chapter introduces a variant of the principle of compositionality in quantitative text semantics as an alternative to the bag-of-features approach. The variant includes effects of context-sensitive interpretation as well as processes of meaning constitution and change in the sense of usage-based semantics. Its starting point is a combination of semantic space modeling and text structure analysis. The principle is implemented by means of a hierarchical constraint satisfaction process which utilizes the notion of hierarchical text structure superimposed by graph-inducing coherence relations. The major contribution of the chapter is a conceptualization and formalization of the principle of compositionality in terms of semantic spaces which tackles some well known deficits of existing approaches. In particular this relates to the missing linguistic interpretability of statistical meaning representations.

In this paper, we firstly give an improved semantic smoothing model for text data stream environment. Then we use the improved semantic model to improve the clustering quality and present an online clustering algorithm for clustering massive text data streams. In our algorithm, a new cluster statistics structure, cluster profile, is presented in which the semantics of text data streams are captured.

15233;"The semantic representation of temporal expressions in text";0;"Dale, R. and Mazur, P.";"Temporal expressions - references to points in time or periods of time - are widespread in text, and their proper interpretation is essential for any natural language processing task that requires the extraction of temporal information. Work on the interpretation of temporal expressions in text has generally been pursued in one of two paradigms: the formal semantics approach, where an attempt is made to provide a well-grounded theoretical basis for the interpretation of these expressions, and the more pragmatically-focused approach represented by the development of the TIMEX2 standard, with its origins in work in information extraction. The former emphasises formal elegance and consistency; the latter emphasises broad coverage for practical applications. In this paper, we report on the development of a framework that attempts to integrate insights from both perspectives, with the aim of achieving broad coverage of the domain in a well-grounded manner from a formal perspective. We focus in particular on the development of a compact notation for representing the semantics of underspecified temporal expressions that enables the component-level evaluation of systems.

A formal semantic representation of linguistic inputs is introduced and utilized to build a semantic representation for documents. The representation is constructed through accumulation of syntactic and semantic analysis outputs. A new distance measure is developed to determine the similarities between contents of documents. The measure is based on inexact matching of attributed trees. It involves the computation of all distinct similarity common sub-trees, and can be computed efficiently. It is believed that the proposed representation along with the proposed similarity measure will enable more effective document mining processes. The proposed techniques to mine documents were implemented as components in a mining system. A case study of semantic document clustering is presented to demonstrate the working and the efficacy of the framework. Experimental work is reported, and its results are presented and analyzed.

Especially, the ant movement rule is adjusted so as to direct a laden ant toward a dense area of the same type of items as the ants carrying item, and to direct an unladen ant toward an area that contains an item dissimilar with the surrounding items within its Moore neighborhood. Using WordNet as the base ontology for assessing the semantic similarity between documents, the proposed algorithm is tested with a sample set of documents excerpted from the Reuters-21578 corpus and the experiment results partly indicate that the proposed algorithm perform better than the standard ant-based text-clustering algorithm and the k-means algorithm.

15247;"A proposal for annotation, semantic similarity and classification of textual documents";0;"Nauer, E. and Napoli, A.";"In this paper, we present an approach for classifying documents based on the notion of a semantic similarity and the effective representation of the content of the documents. The content of a document is annotated and the resulting annotation is represented by a labeled tree whose nodes and edges are represented by concepts lying within a domain ontology. A reasoning process may be carried out on annotation trees, allowing the comparison of documents between each others, for classification or information retrieval purposes. An algorithm for classifying documents with respect to semantic similarity and a discussion conclude the paper.

15250;"Enhancing Text Categorization with Semantic-enriched Representation and Training Data Augmentation";0;"Lu, X.a  and Zheng, B.a  and Velivelli, A.b  and Zhai, C.c ";"Objective: Acquiring and representing biomedical knowledge is an increasingly important component of contemporary bioinformatics. A critical step of the process is to identify and retrieve relevant documents among the vast volume of modern biomedical literature efficiently. In the real world, many information retrieval tasks are difficult because of high data dimensionality and the lack of annotated examples to train a retrieval algorithm. Under such a scenario, the performance of information retrieval algorithms is often unsatisfactory, therefore improvements are needed. Design: We studied two approaches that enhance the text categorization performance on sparse and high data dimensionality: (1) semantic-preserving dimension reduction by representing text with semantic-enriched features; and (2) augmenting training data with semi-supervised learning. A probabilistic topic model was applied to extract major semantic topics from a corpus of text of interest. The representation of documents was projected from the high-dimensional vocabulary space onto a semantic topic space with reduced dimensionality. A semi-supervised learning algorithm based on graph theory was applied to identify potential positive training cases, which were further used to augment training data. The effects of data transformation and augmentation on text categorization by support vector machine (SVM) were evaluated. Results and Conclusion: Semantic-enriched data transformation and the pseudo-positive-cases augmented training data enhance the efficiency and performance of text categorization by SVM.

15256;"Semantic correlation network based text clustering";0;"Song, S. and Li, C.";"Text documents have sparse data spaces, and nearest neighbors may belong to different classes when using current existing proximity measures to describe the correlation of documents. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric similarity measure to strengthen the discriminative feature of document objects. We construct a semantic correlation network by asymmetric similarity between documents and conjecture the power law feature of the connections distributions. Hub points which exist in semantic correlation network are classified by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach named SCN. Both objects similarity and neighbors similarity are considered in the definition of hub points proximity. Finally, we assign the rest text objects to their nearest hub points. The experimental evaluation on textual data sets demonstrates the validity and efficiency of SCN. The comparison with other clustering algorithms shows the superiority of our approach.

This paper presents a hybrid approach of a text-mining technique for measuring semantic relatedness among texts. In this work we develop several text classifiers using Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to supporting acquisition of relatedness among texts. First, we utilized our developed text mining algorithms, including text mining techniques based on classification of texts in several text collections. After that, we employ various SVM classifiers to deal with evaluation of relatedness of the target documents.

In addition to relying on labeled training data, we improve classification accuracy by incorporating the set of test examples in the classification process. Rather than performing LSIs singular value decomposition (SVD) process solely on the training data, we instead use an expanded term-by-document matrix that includes both the labeled data as well as any available test examples. We report the performance of LSI on data sets both with and without the inclusion of the test examples, and we show that tailoring the SVD process to the test examples can be even more useful than adding additional training data. This method can be especially useful to combat possible inclusion of unrelated data in the original corpus, and to compensate for limited amounts of data. Additionally, we evaluate the vocabulary of the training and test sets and present the results of a series of experiments to illustrate how the test set is used in an advantageous way.

It always drops the text classification performance when being applied to the whole training set (global LSI) because this completely unsupervised method ignores class discrimination while only concentrating on representation. Some local LSI methods have been proposed to improve the classification by utilizing class discrimination information. However, their performance improvements over original term vectors are still very limited. In this paper, we propose a new local LSI method called ""Local Relevancy Weighted LSI"" to improve text classification by performing a separate Single Value Decomposition (SVD) on the transformed local region of each class. Experimental results show that our method is much better than global LSI and traditional local LSI methods on classification within a much smaller LSI dimension.

In this work, we propose an alternative solution for acquisition of semantic relatedness from text corpora by means of a machine learning technique, namely the self-organizing maps.

Using SOM-based automatic clustering techniques, we have conducted several experiments to uncover associated documents based on Chinese-English bilingual parallel corpora, and a hybrid Chinese-English corpus.

15275;"Neural network agents for learning semantic text classification";0;"Wermter, S.";"The research project AgNeT develops Agents for Neural Text routing in the internet. Unrestricted potentially faulty text messages arrive at a certain delivery point (e.g. email address or world wide web address). These text messages are scanned and then distributed to one of several expert agents according to a certain task criterium. Possible specific scenarios within this framework include the learning of the routing of publication titles or news titles. In this paper we describe extensive experiments for semantic text routing based on classified library titles and newswire titles. This task is challenging since incoming messages may contain constructions which have not been anticipated. Therefore, the contributions of this research are in learning and generalizing neural architectures for the robust interpretation of potentially noisy unrestricted messages. Neural networks were developed and examined for this topic since they support robustness and learning in noisy unrestricted real-world texts. We describe and compare different sets of experiments. The first set of experiments tests a recurrent neural network for the task of library title classification. Then we describe a larger more difficult newswire classification task from information retrieval. The comparison of the examined models demonstrates that techniques from information retrieval integrated into recurrent plausibility networks performed well even under noise and for different corpora.

15282;"Towards a machine of a process (MOP) ontology to facilitate e-commerce of industrial machinery";0;"Ramos, L.a  and Gil, R.b  and Anastasiou, D.a  and Martin-Bautista, M.J.b ";"Adapting to users requirements is a key factor for enterprise success. Despite the existence of several approaches that point in this direction, simplifying integration and interoperability among users, suppliers and the enterprise during product lifecycle, is still an open issue. Ontologies have been used in some manufacturing applications and they promise to be a valid approach to model manufacturing resources of enterprises (e.g. machinery and raw material). Nevertheless, in this domain, most of the ontologies have been developed following methodologies based on development from scratch, thus ontologies previously developed have been discarded. Such ontological methodologies tend to hold the interoperability issues in some level. In this paper, a method that integrates ontology reuse with ontology validation and learning is presented. An upper (top-level) ontology for manufacturing was used as a reference to evaluate and to improve specific domain ontology. The evaluation procedure was based on the systemic methodology for ontology learning (SMOL). As a result of the application of SMOL, an ontology entitled Machine of a Process (MOP) was developed. The terminology included in MOP was validated by means of a text mining procedure called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) which was carried out on documents from the domain in this study. Competency questions were performed on preexisting domain ontologies and MOP, proving that this new ontology has a performance better than the domain ontologies used as seed.

Most of the tools which address this problem use XML tagging and other Web 3.0 approaches, which do not address the actual content of blog posts and the associated commentary. We give a tutorial review of latent semantic analysis and the self-organizing maps, as considered in this context, and show how to apply the self-organizing map over a probabilistic latent semantic space to the problem of completely unsupervised clustering of unstructured text in such a way as to be entirely independent of spelling, grammar, and even source language. This provides an algorithm suitable for clustering free-form commentary with a well-structured test environment. The algorithm is applied to academic paper abstracts instead, treated as unstructured text as though they were blog posts, because this set of documents has a known ground truth. The algorithm constructs a word category map and a document map in which words with similar meaning and documents with similar content are clustered together.

In the second step, we tried to identify terms belonging to vocabularies used in the Digital Libraries domain, which could be used for specifying the UML conceptualization. To this end, we investigated several existing ontologies, and we chose the terms that we considered useful to represent our knowledge. In order to describe all the knowledge embedded in the notes, we added classes and properties. Finally, we built a RDF graph that represents the semantics of the notes.

The methodology combines semantic term similarities with a vector similarity method used within statistical analysis. A modification of the term vectors using synset similarity values addresses issues that are encountered with sparse text.

It looked at the amount of detecting plagiarized sentences from the original documents. Experiments have been carried out using the CS11 standard plagiarism detection corpus.

15305;"Timeline adaptation for text classification";0;"Fukumoto, F.a  and Suzuki, Y.a  and Takasu, A.b ";"In this paper, we address the text classification problem that a period of time created test data is different from the training data, and present a method for text classification based on temporal adaptation. We first applied lexical chains for the training data to collect terms with semantic relatedness, and created sets (we call these Sem sets). Semantically related terms in the documents are replaced to their representative term. For the results, we identified short terms that are salient for a specific period of time. Finally, we trained SVM classifiers by applying a temporal weighting function to each selected short terms within the training data, and classified test data. Temporal weighting function is weighted each short term in the training data according to the temporal distance between training and test data. The results using MedLine data showed that the method was comparable to the current state-of-the-art biased-SVM method, especially the method is effective when testing on data far from the training data.

15308;"Probabilistic semantic similarity measurements for noisy short texts using wikipedia entities";0;"Shirakawa, M.a  and Nakayama, K.b  and Hara, T.a  and Nishio, S.a ";"This paper describes a novel probabilistic method of measuring semantic similarity for real-world noisy short texts like microblog posts. Our method adds related Wikipedia entities to a short text as its semantic representation and uses the vector of entities for computing semantic similarity. Adding related entities to texts is generally a compound problem that involves the extraction of key terms, finding related entities for each key term, and the aggregation of related entities. Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a popular Wikipedia-based method, solves these problems by summing the weighted vectors of related entities. However, this heuristic weighting highly depends on the rule of majority decision and is not suited to short texts that contain few key terms but many noisy terms. The proposed probabilistic method synthesizes these procedures by extending naive Bayes and achieves robust estimates of related Wikipedia entities for short texts. Experimental results on short text clustering using Twitter data indicated that our method outperformed ESA for short texts containing noisy terms.

15310;"A multi-level text representation model within background knowledge based on human cognitive process";0;"Zhang, J.a  and Li, Q.b  and Luo, X.a  and Wei, X.a ";"Text representation is one of the most fundamental works in text comprehension, processing, and search. Various works have been proposed to mine the semantics in texts and then to represent them. However, most of them only focus on how to mine semantics from the text itself while the background knowledge, which is very important to text understanding, is not taken into consideration. In this paper, on the basis of human cognitive process, we propose a multi-level text representation model within background knowledge, called TRMBK. It is composed of three levels, which are machine surface code (MSC), machine text base (MTB) and machine situational model (MSM). All of the three are able to be automatically constructed to acquire semantics both inside and outside of the text. Simultaneously, we also propose a method to automatically establish background knowledge and offer supports for the current text comprehension. Finally, experiments and comparisons have been presented to show the better performance of TRMBK.

Blogs published and shared by users in this virtual world are one of the main sources of user-generated information. Classifying these freestyle blogs can help understand user interests and assist applications such as search and marketing. In this paper, we propose a new method of multi-label classification for Chinese blogs. By applying Dempster-Shafer theory on semantic word similarity algorithms, we achieve automatic classification without use of difficult-to-obtain training sets.

15313;"Unsupervised biomedical named entity recognition: Experiments with clinical and biological texts";0;"Zhang, S. and Elhadad, N.";"Named entity recognition is a crucial component of biomedical natural language processing, enabling information extraction and ultimately reasoning over and knowledge discovery from text. Much progress has been made in the design of rule-based and supervised tools, but they are often genre and task dependent. As such, adapting them to different genres of text or identifying new types of entities requires major effort in re-annotation or rule development. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to extracting named entities from biomedical text. We describe a stepwise solution to tackle the challenges of entity boundary detection and entity type classification without relying on any handcrafted rules, heuristics, or annotated data. A noun phrase chunker followed by a filter based on inverse document frequency extracts candidate entities from free text. Classification of candidate entities into categories of interest is carried out by leveraging principles from distributional semantics. Experiments show that our system, especially the entity classification step, yields competitive results on two popular biomedical datasets of clinical notes and biological literature, and outperforms a baseline dictionary match approach.

In traditional text classification methods, document texts are represented with Bag of Words (BOW) text representation schema, which is based on word co-occurrence and has many limitations. In this paper, we mapped document texts to Wikipedia concepts and used the Wikipedia-concept-based document representation method to take the place of traditional BOW model for text classification. In order to overcome the weakness of ignoring the semantic relationships among terms in document representation model and utilize rich semantic knowledge in Wikipedia, we constructed a semantic matrix to enrich Wikipedia-concept-based document representation. Experimental evaluation on five real datasets of long and short text shows that our approach outperforms the traditional BOW method.

However, information extracted from text does not easily fit into the usually highly normalized structure of ontology-based datasets. While the representation of structured data assumes a high level of regularity, relatively simple and consistent conceptual models, the representation of information extracted from texts need to take into account large terminological variation, complex contextual/dependency patterns, and fuzzy or conflicting semantics. This work focuses on bridging the gap between structured and unstructured data, proposing the representation of text as structured discourse graphs (SDGs), targeting an RDF representation of unstructured data. The representation focuses on a semantic best-effort information extraction scenario, where information from text is extracted under a pay-as-you-go data quality perspective, trading terminological normalization for domain-independency, context capture, wider representation scope and maximization of textual information capture.

15331;"HLDA based text clustering";0;"Liu, P. and Li, L. and Heng, W. and Wang, B.";"LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model has been applied into many applications in recent years. But LDA has a shortcoming that it cannot deal with various changes of data set well, which has become a limitation for its applications. Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) is a generalization of LDA and it can adapt itself to the growing data set automatically. hLDA can mine latent topics from a large amount of discrete data and organize these topics into a hierarchy, in which the topics of higher level are more abstractive while the topics of lower level are more specific. This hierarchy could achieve a deeper semantic model which is similar with human mind. Given a set of documents, hLDA generates a prior distribution of Bayesian nonparametrics using a nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP)[1].

15332;"Research on automatic semantic classification of human-interaction instructions";0;"Yuan, S. and Wang, X.";"Instructions extraction extracts structured information from unstructured natural language instruction text, is an application of information extraction in the field of human-computer interaction. For a natural language instruction text, if we want to extract structural information which can able to describe the text semantic completely, it is critical to position these words or phrases and mark one description which belongs to their own semantic description. This paper first try to a solution which is semantic classification based on dictionary. Because of some shortcomings of the dictionary itself, the semantic classification results are poor. Through the analysis of dictionary-based semantic classification results, this paper proposes a semantic classification method which combining CRF, self-training and Dictionary. Use this method to conduct experiments in the field of vehicle. The experiment results show that our method can be effective in semantic classification for the natural language instruction text; the overall correct rate is 92%.

15335;"GraphSum: Discovering correlations among multiple terms for graph-based summarization";0;"Baralis, E.a  and Cagliero, L.a  and Mahoto, N.a  and Fiori, A.b ";"Graph-based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph-based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. However, since the high-order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation, the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language-dependent or semantics-based analysis. This paper presents a novel and general-purpose graph-based summarizer, namely GraphSum (Graph-based Summarizer). It discovers and exploits association rules to represent the correlations among multiple terms that have been neglected by previous approaches. The graph nodes, which represent combinations of two or more terms, are first ranked by means of a PageRank strategy that discriminates between positive and negative term correlations. Then, the produced node ranking is used to drive the sentence selection process. The experiments performed on benchmark and real-life documents demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to many state-of-the-art summarizers. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

These standards are traditionally text based documents for human interpretation, but prose sections can often be ambiguous and can lead to discrepancies. Many organisations will produce semantic representations of the material. In developing these semantic representations, no relationship is maintained to the original prose. Maintaining the relationships has key benefits, including assessing conformance at a semantic level rather than prose, and enabling original content authors to explicitly define their intentions. This paper proposes a framework to help achieve these benefits.

15342;"Minimally-supervised learning of domain-specific causal relations using an open-domain corpus as knowledge base";0;"Ittoo, A.a  and Bouma, G.b ";"We propose a novel framework for overcoming the challenges in extracting causal relations from domain-specific texts. Our technique is minimally-supervised, alleviating the need for manually-annotated, expensive training data. As our main contribution, we show that open-domain corpora can be exploited as knowledge bases to overcome data sparsity issues posed by domain-specific relation extraction, and that they enable substantial performance gains. We also address longstanding challenges of extant minimally-supervised approaches. To suppress the negative impact of semantic drift, we propose a technique based on the Latent Relational Hypothesis. In addition, our approach discovers both explicit (e.g. ""to cause"") and implicit (e.g. ""to destroy"") causal patterns/relations. Unlike existing minimally-supervised techniques, we adopt a principled seed selection strategy, which enables us to discover a more diverse set of causal patterns/relations. Our experiments reveal that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline in discovering causal relations from a real-life, domain-specific corpus.

In particular, a great potential comes from the integration of the many heterogeneous information sources currently available on the Web. In this article we focus on the correlation between genes and biological processes. In this context, we present a methodology for integrating information from biomedical literature with other heterogeneous types of structured information. In particular, the information sources integrated in this work are PubMed abstracts, pathway databases, and NCI thesaurus definitions. The integration is performed at the semantic analysis level using a customized approach we developed to modulate the impact of the different sources on the correlation score. We report the results of a study concerning the impact of the information integration on the correlation score and of the user-level parameters we introduced to modulate the impact of pathway data or NCI definitions with respect to biomedical literature information, depending on the context of the search. To evaluate the methodology, we performed correlation measures on six biological processes and nine genes by comparing the results with and without the integration of pathways and NCI definitions.

15347;"Precise tweet classification and sentiment analysis";0;"Batool, R.a  and Khattak, A.M.c  and Maqbool, J.b  and Lee, S.a ";"The rise of social media in couple of years has changed the general perspective of networking, socialization, and personalization. Use of data from social networks for different purposes, such as election prediction, sentimental analysis, marketing, communication, business, and education, is increasing day by day. Precise extraction of valuable information from short text messages posted on social media (Twitter) is a collaborative task. In this paper, we analyze tweets to classify data and sentiments from Twitter more precisely. The information from tweets are extracted using keyword based knowledge extraction. Moreover, the extracted knowledge is further enhanced using domain specific seed based enrichment technique. The proposed methodology facilitates the extraction of keywords, entities, synonyms, and parts of speech from tweets which are then used for tweets classification and sentimental analysis. The proposed system is tested on a collection of 40,000 tweets. The proposed methodology has performed better than the existing system in terms of tweets classification and sentiment analysis. By applying the Knowledge Enhancer and Synonym Binder module on the extracted information we have achieved increase in information gain in a range of 0.1% to 55%. The increase in information gain has enabled our proposed system to better summarize the twitter data for user sentiments regarding a keyword from a particular category.

While clustering has been studied for other types of data, little work has been done on clustering forum threads; the informal nature and special structure of forum data make it interesting to study how to effectively cluster forum threads. In this paper, we apply three state of the art clustering methods (i.e., hierarchical agglomerative clustering, k-Means, and probabilistic latent semantic analysis) to cluster forum threads and study how to leverage the structure of threads to improve clustering accuracy. We propose three different methods for assigning weights to the posts in a forum thread to achieve more accurate representation of a thread. We evaluate all the methods on data collected from three different Linux forums for both within-forum and across-forum clustering. Our results show that the state of the art methods perform reasonably well for this task, but the performance can be further improved by exploiting thread structures. In particular, a parabolic weighting method that assigns higher weights for both beginning posts and end posts of a thread is shown to consistently outperform a standard clustering method.

In order to accomplish this, extracting the semantic information of functional expressions plays a crucial role, because functional expressions such as would like to and cant are key expressions to detecting customers needs and wants. However, in Japanese, functional expressions appear in the form of suffixes, and two different types of functional expressions are merged into one predicate: one influences the factual meaning of the predicate while the other is merely used for discourse purposes. This triggers an increase in surface forms, which hinders information extraction systems. In this article, we present a novel normalization technique that paraphrases complex functional expressions into simplified forms that retain only the crucial meaning of the predicate. We construct paraphrasing rules based on linguistic theories in syntax and semantics. The results of experiments indicate that our system achieves a high accuracy of 79.7%, while it reduces the differences in functional expressions by up to 66.7%. The results also show an improvement in the performance of predicate extraction, providing encouraging evidence of the usability of paraphrasing as a means of normalizing different language expressions.

15352;"Class-dependent Canonical Correlation Analysis for scalable cross-lingual document categorization";0;"Abdel Hady, M.F. and Asham, M.";"Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is used to infer a semantic space into which text documents, written in different languages, can be mapped to a language-independent representation, called latent topics. This highly reduces the complexity of dealing with different languages since we can train a document classifier using the labeled documents in one language, and then apply it to classify documents in another language. This topic modeling task is usually performed in a class-independent manner. The performance of CCA depends on the amount of documents used for inferring the semantic space. However, CCA has a high computational complexity with respect to the number of training documents. In this paper, we proposed a scalable variant of CCA, CD-CCA, to improve its scalability and complexity where the projection is performed in a class-dependent manner. It generates a semantic space for each category separately. Then a binary document classifier is trained for each category on its own semantic space. CD-CCA was applied on English-Chinese document classification. The experimental results showed that CD-CCA can deal with large training sets without hurting the performance of the underlying classifiers compared to traditional CCA. CD-CCA opens the door for distributed training of the semantic spaces of the different categories.

15358;"Exploring domain-sensitive features for extractive summarization in the medical domain";0;"Nguyen, D.T.a  and Leveling, J.b ";"This paper describes experiments to adapt document summarization to the medical domain. Our summarizer combines linguistic features corresponding to text fragments (typically sentences) and applies a machine learning approach to extract the most important text fragments from a document to form a summary. The generic features comprise features used in previous research on summarization. We propose to adapt the summarizer to the medical domain by adding domain-specific features. We explore two types of additional features: medical domain features and semantic features. The evaluation of the summarizer is based on medical articles and targets different aspects: i) the classification of text fragments into ones which are important and ones which are unimportant for a summary; ii) analyzing the effect of each feature on the performance; and iii) system improvement over our baseline summarizer when adding features for domain adaptation. Evaluation metrics include accuracy for training the sentence extraction and the ROUGE measure computed for reference summaries. We achieve an accuracy of 84.16% on medical balanced training data by using an IB1 classifier. Training on unbalanced data achieves higher accuracy than training on balanced data. Domain adaptation using all domain-specific features outperforms the baseline summarization wrt. ROUGE scores, which shows the successful domain adaptation with simple means.

We have developed TopicView, an application for visually comparing and exploring multiple models of text corpora, as a prototype for this type of analysis tool. TopicView uses multiple linked views to visually analyze conceptual and topical content, document relationships identified by models, and the impact of models on the results of document clustering. As case studies, we examine models created using two standard approaches: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Conceptual content is compared through the combination of (i) a bipartite graph matching LSA concepts with LDA topics based on the cosine similarities of model factors and (ii) a table containing the terms for each LSA concept and LDA topic listed in decreasing order of importance. Document relationships are examined through the combination of (i) side-by-side document similarity graphs, (ii) a table listing the weights for each documents contribution to each concept/topic, and (iii) a full text reader for documents selected in either of the graphs or the table. The impact of LSA and LDA models on document clustering applications is explored through similar means, using proximities between documents and cluster exemplars for graph layout edge weighting and table entries. We demonstrate the utility of TopicViews visual approach to model assessment by comparing LSA and LDA models of several example corpora.

As an example, a document repository for metals processing technology was used. The system by using ontological model provides the user with a new approach to the exploration of database resources - easier and more intuitive information search. In the current document storage systems, searching is often based only on keywords and descriptions created manually by the system administrator. The use of text mining methods, especially latent semantic indexing, allows automatic clustering of documents with respect to their content.

15370;"A comprehensive analysis of using semantic information in text categorization";0;"Celik, K. and Gungor, T.";"Traditional text categorization methods only deal with the content of the documents and use some statistic based metrics to represent the documents. The representation is then used by a machine learning approach to determine the document class. In this picture, the meaning of the document is missing. In order to add meaning into the text categorization process, we start with using part-of-speech tagging (POS). As expected, in a document each part-of-speech tag does not contribute the same amount of information to the document meaning. In addition to the POS information, we make use of WordNet to add semantic features such as synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms and topics into classification process. Using WordNets semantic features introduces ambiguity and not all semantic features are really related to the document content. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new method to eliminate the ambiguity. Various combinations of POS, WordNet and word sense disambiguation are applied and the results show that using semantic features perform better than the traditional, context based methods.

Smoothing can be a solution for this problem, mostly Laplace Smoothing is used; however in this paper we propose Wikipedia based semantic smoothing approach. In our study we extend semantic approach by using Wikipedia article titles that exist in training documents, categories and redirects of these articles as topic signatures.

Termhood is one essential measure for judging whether a phrase is a term. Previous researches on termhood mainly depend on the word frequency information. In this paper, we propose to compute termhood based on semantic representation of words. A novel topic model, namely i-SWB, is developed to map the domain corpus into a latent semantic space, which is composed of some general topics, a background topic and a documents-specific topic. Experiments on four domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ATE approaches.

15385;"Automatic discovery of person-related named-entity in news articles based on verb analysis";0;"Goh, H.-N. and Soon, L.-K. and Haw, S.-C.";"Verb is the most important word in a sentence as it asserts an action, events, feeling about the subject and object discussed in the sentence. For news articles, it is observable that there is always at least a verb attached to the person(s) mentioned in the news. As such, a hypothesis has been formed such that there must exist some verbs that specifically describe human being conducts within a news article. In this paper, we propose an approach which aims to identify named-entity (NE) that performs human activity automatically. More specifically, our approach attempts to identify person-related NE generally and ""person name"" predefined type specifically by studying the nature of verb that associated with human activity via TreeTagger, Stanford packages and WordNet. The experimental results show that it is viable to use verb in identifying ""person name""entity type. In addition, our empirical study proves that the approach is applicable to small text size articles. Another significant contribution of our approach is that it does not require training data set and anaphora resolution.

Previous methods for clustering biomedical documents are not necessarily effective for integrating different types of information, by which only one or two types of information have been used. Recently, the performance of MEDLINE document clustering has been enhanced by linearly combining both the LC and MS information. However, the simple linear combination could be ineffective because of the limitation of the representation space for combining different types of information (similarities) with different reliability. To overcome the limitation, we propose a new semisupervised spectral clustering method, i.e., SSNCut, for clustering over the LC similarities, with two types of constraints: must-link (ML) constraints on document pairs with high MS (or GC) similarities and cannot-link (CL) constraints on those with low similarities. We empirically demonstrate the performance of SSNCut on MEDLINE document clustering, by using 100 data sets of MEDLINE records. Experimental results show that SSNCut outperformed a linear combination method and several well-known semisupervised clustering methods, being statistically significant. Furthermore, the performance of SSNCut with constraints from both MS and GC similarities outperformed that from only one type of similarities. Another interesting finding was that ML constraints more effectively worked than CL constraints, since CL constraints include around 10% incorrect ones, whereas this number was only 1% for ML constraints.

15393;"Emotions in text: Dimensional and categorical models";0;"Calvo, R.A. and Mac Kim, S.";"Text often expresses the writers emotional state or evokes emotions in the reader. The nature of emotional phenomena like reading and writing can be interpreted in different ways and represented with different computational models. Affective computing (AC) researchers often use a categorical model in which text data are associated with emotional labels. We introduce a new way of using normative databases as a way of processing text with a dimensional model and compare it with different categorical approaches. The approach is evaluated using four data sets of texts reflecting different emotional phenomena. An emotional thesaurus and a bag-of-words model are used to generate vectors for each pseudo-document, then for the categorical models three dimensionality reduction techniques are evaluated: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). For the dimensional model a normative database is used to produce three-dimensional vectors (valence, arousal, dominance) for each pseudo-document. This three-dimensional model can be used to generate psychologically driven visualizations. Both models can be used for affect detection based on distances amongst categories and pseudo-documents. Experiments show that the categorical model using NMF and the dimensional model tend to perform best.

15396;"Data-driven analysis of emotion in text using latent affective folding and embedding";0;"Bellegarda, J.R.";"Submitted to Special Issue on ""Computational Approaches to Analysis of Emotion in Text"" Guest editors: Diana Inkpen and Carlo Strapparava Initial publication: NAACL-HLT 2010 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Analysis and Generation of Emotion in Text, June 5, 2010, Los Angeles, CA Though data-driven in nature, emotion analysis based on latent semantic analysis still relies on some measure of expert knowledge to isolate the emotional keywords or keysets necessary to the construction of affective categories. This makes it vulnerable to any discrepancy between the ensuing taxonomy of affective states and the underlying domain of discourse. This paper proposes a more general strategy which leverages two separate semantic levels: one that encapsulates the foundations of the domain considered, and one that specifically accounts for the overall affective fabric of the language. Exposing the emergent relationship between these two levels advantageously informs the emotion classification process. Empirical evidence suggests that this approach is promising for automatic emotion analysis in text. This bodes well for its deployability in a variety of applications, such as sentiment prediction.

15398;"Towards savvy adoption of semantic technology: From published use cases to category-specific adopter readiness models";0;"Nekvasil, M.a  and SvÃ¡tek, V.b ";"The decision of organizations to invest (or not) into a semantic application is, currently, often based on vague considerations and personal feelings. What is lacking is a model that would help determine whether semantic approaches would be adequate, given the aspects of the particular business and concrete adopter. Such a model would however need to take into account the heterogeneity of different applications that exhibit semantic features. We present a thorough exercise, and a prototypical methodology abstracted from it, for proceeding in multiple steps, from loosely sorted and purely textual descriptions of semantic applications to structured and instructive adopter readiness models. The whole process relies on expert-level manual analysis of textual descriptions, automatic cluster analysis (leading to plausible categories of semantic applications), critical factor analysis, questionnaire survey addressing the developers of applications, and adaptation of principles known from building multi-layer Capability Maturity Models.

15399;"IBminer: A text mining tool for constructing and populating infobox databases and knowledge bases";0;"Mousavi, H. and Gao, S. and Zaniolo, C.";"Knowledge bases and structured summaries are playing a crucial role in many applications, such as text summarization, question answering, essay grading, and semantic search. Although, many systems (e.g., DBpedia and YaGo2) provide massive knowledge bases of such summaries, they all suffer from incompleteness, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies. These problems can be addressed and much improved by combining and integrating different knowledge bases, but their very large sizes and their reliance on different terminologies and ontologies make the task very difficult. In this demo, we will demonstrate a system that is achieving good success on this task by: i) employing available interlinks in the current knowledge bases (e.g. externalLink and redirect links in DBpedia) to combine information on individual entities, and ii) using widely available text corpora (e.g. Wikipedia) and our IBminer text-mining system, to generate and verify structured information, and reconcile terminologies across different knowledge bases. We will also demonstrate two tools designed to support the integration process in close collaboration with IBminer. The first is the InfoBox Knowledge-Base Browser (IBKB) which provides structured summaries and their provenance, and the second is the InfoBox Editor (IBE), which is designed to suggest relevant attributes for a user-specified subject, whereby the user can easily improve the knowledge base without requiring any knowledge about the internal terminology of individual systems.

15401;"Multi-document summarization based on the Yago ontology";0;"Baralis, E.a  and Cagliero, L.a  and Jabeen, S.a  and Fiori, A.b  and Shah, S.c ";"Sentence-based multi-document summarization is the task of generating a succinct summary of a document collection, which consists of the most salient document sentences. In recent years, the increasing availability of semantics-based models (e.g., ontologies and taxonomies) has prompted researchers to investigate their usefulness for improving summarizer performance. However, semantics-based document analysis is often applied as a preprocessing step, rather than integrating the discovered knowledge into the summarization process. This paper proposes a novel summarizer, namely Yago-based Summarizer, that relies on an ontology-based evaluation and selection of the document sentences. To capture the actual meaning and context of the document sentences and generate sound document summaries, an established entity recognition and disambiguation step based on the Yago ontology is integrated into the summarization process. The experimental results, which were achieved on the DUC04 benchmark collections, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to a large number of competitors as well as the qualitative soundness of the generated summaries.

It engages Competitive Technical Intelligence concepts and methods for studies of Newly Emerging Science & Technology (NEST) in support of technology management and policy. A semantic TRIZ approach is used to assess NEST innovation patterns by associating topics (using noun phrases to address subjects and objects) and actions (via verbs). We then classify these innovation patterns by the dominant categories of origination: Academy, Industry, or Government. We then use TRIZ tags and benchmarks to locate NEST progress using Technology Roadmapping. Triple Helix inferences can then be related to the visualized patterns. We demonstrate these analyses via a case study for dye-sensitized solar cells.

A large number of narrative class texts contain various events, and events have essential inherent connections among each other in these texts. By studying some traditional text representation method, this paper considers the event as a basic semantic unit for narrative texts, and presents a new event co-occurrence network structure based Chinese text representation method, which combines the characteristics of the graph structure. This method uses event features and the co-occurrence relationship between event features to represent the text, and can retain the structure information and semantic information of the text to a greater extent. The experimental results show that automatic summary based on this method has better performance. 1553-9105/Copyright Â© 2013 Binary Information Press.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";38;"2013";"Journal of Computational Information Systems";;"Article";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84880387828&partnerID=40&md5=e0f07f28089f697b6cfeac3b60f787dc";"9";"5535-5542";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"24/06/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"representacao textual";"null";"event co-occurrence network";"null";"null";"event extraction, sumarizacao";"chines";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"8"
15409;"An implementation of clustering project proposals on ontology based text mining approach";0;"Preethi, T.a  and Lakshmi, R.b ";"The NSFC is the largest government funding agency in China, with the primary aim to fund and manage basic research. The agency is made up of seven scientific departments, four bureaus, one general office, and three associated units. The scientific departments are the decision-making units responsible for funding recommendations and management of funded projects. Selection of research projects is an important and recurring activity in many organizations such as government research funding agencies. Current method of grouping proposals are based on manual matching of similar research discipline areas but it fails to be accurate. Text clustering methods those are not having semantic approach provide less accuracy. A novel ontology based text mining approach to cluster proposals is proposed. Research project selection is an important task for government and private research funding agencies. When a large number of research proposals are received, it is common to group them according to their similarities in research disciplines. The grouped proposals are then assigned to the appropriate experts for peer review. The review results are collected, and the proposals are then ranked based on the aggregation of the experts review results.

15410;"Some experiments on modeling stock market behavior using investor sentiment analysis and posting volume from twitter";0;"Oliveira, N.a  and Cortez, P.a  and Areal, N.b ";"The analysis of microblogging data related with stock markets can reveal relevant new signals of investor sentiment and attention. It may also provide sentiment and attention indicators in a more rapid and cost-effective manner than other sources. In this study, we created several indicators using Twitter data and investigated their value when modeling relevant stock market variables, namely returns, trading volume and volatility. We collected recent data from nine major technological companies. Several sentiment analysis methods were explored, by comparing 5 popular lexical resources and two novel lexicons (emoticon based and the merge of all 6 lexicons) and sentiment indicators produced using two strategies (based on daily words and individual tweet classifications). Also, we measured posting volume associated with tweets related to the analyzed companies. While a short time period is considered (32 days), we found scarce evidence that sentiment indicators can explain these stock returns. However, interesting results were obtained when measuring the value of using posting volume for fitting trading volume and, in particular, volatility.

To extract such opinioned statements from the reports, we built tagging models based on the conditional random field (CRF) techniques, considering a variety of combinations of linguistic factors including morphology, orthography, predicate-argument structure, syntax, and simple semantics. Our results show that the CRF models are reasonably effective to find opinion holders in experiments when we adopted the popular MPQA corpus for training and testing. The contribution of our paper is to identify opinion patterns in multiword expressions (MWEs) forms rather than in single word forms.

15416;"Protecting research and technology from espionage";0;"Thorleuchter, D.a  and Van Den Poel, D.b ";"In recent years, governmental and industrial espionage becomes an increased problem for governments and corporations. Especially information about current technology development and research activities are interesting targets for espionage. Thus, we introduce a new and automated methodology that investigates the information leakage risk of projects in research and technology (R&T) processed by an organization concerning governmental or industrial espionage. Latent semantic indexing is applied together with machine based learning and prediction modeling. This identifies semantic textual patterns representing technologies and their corresponding application fields that are of high relevance for the organizations strategy. These patterns are used to estimate organizations costs of an information leakage for each project. Further, a web mining approach is processed to identify worldwide knowledge distribution within the relevant technologies and corresponding application fields. This information is used to estimate the probability that an information leakage occur. A risk assessment methodology calculates the information leakage risk for each project. In a case study, the information leakage risk of defense based R&T projects is investigated. This is because defense based R&T is of particularly interest by espionage agents. Overall, it can be shown that the proposed methodology is successful in calculation the espionage information leakage risk of projects. This supports an organization by processing espionage risk management. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

15417;"Storing and analysing voice of the market data in the corporate data warehouse";0;"GarcÃ­a-Moya, L. and Kudama, S. and Aramburu, M.J. and Berlanga, R.";"Web opinion feeds have become one of the most popular information sources users consult before buying products or contracting services. Negative opinions about a product can have a high impact in its sales figures. As a consequence, companies are more and more concerned about how to integrate opinion data in their business intelligence models so that they can predict sales figures or define new strategic goals. After analysing the requirements of this new application, this paper proposes a multidimensional data model to integrate sentiment data extracted from opinion posts in a traditional corporate data warehouse. Then, a new sentiment data extraction method that applies semantic annotation as a means to facilitate the integration of both types of data is presented. In this method, Wikipedia is used as the main knowledge resource, together with some well-known lexicons of opinion words and other corporate data and metadata stores describing the company products like, for example, technical specifications and user manuals. The resulting information system allows users to perform new analysis tasks by using the traditional OLAP-based data warehouse operators. We have developed a case study over a set of real opinions about digital devices which are offered by a wholesale dealer. Over this case study, the quality of the extracted sentiment data is evaluated, and some query examples that illustrate the potential uses of the integrated model are provided.

15420;"Advanced computational reasoning based on the NKRL conceptual model";0;"Zarri, G.P.";"After having recalled some well-known shortcomings linked with the Semantic Web approach to the creation of (application oriented) systems of ""rules""-e.g.; limited expressiveness, adoption of an Open World Assumption (OWA) paradigm, absence of variables in the original definition of OWL-this paper examines the technical solutions successfully used for implementing advanced reasoning systems according to the NKRLs methodology. NKRL (Narrative Knowledge Representation Language) is a conceptual meta-model and a Computer Science environment expressly created to deal, in an intelligent and complete way, with complex and content-rich non-fictional narrative data sources. These last include corporate memory documents, news stories, normative and legal texts, medical records, surveillance videos, actuality photos for newspapers and magazines, etc. In this context, we will expound first the need for distinguishing between ""plain/static"" and ""structured/dynamic"" knowledge and for introducing appropriate (and different) knowledge representation structures for these two types of knowledge. In a structured/dynamic context, we will then show how the introduction of ""functional roles""-associated with the possibility of making use of n-ary structures-allows us to build up highly expressive rules whose ""atoms"" can directly represent complex situations, actions, etc. without being restricted to the use of binary clauses. In an NKRL context, ""functional roles"" are primitive symbols interpreted as ""relations""-like ""subject"", ""object"", ""source"", ""beneficiary"", etc.-that link a semantic predicate with its arguments within an n-ary conceptual formula. Functional roles contrast then with the ""semantic roles"" that are equated to ordinary concepts like ""student"", to be inserted into the ""non- sortal"" (no direct instances) branch of a traditional ontology.

15423;"High performance genetic algorithm based text clustering using parts of speech and outlier elimination";0;"Shi, K.a  and Li, L.b ";"Among the typical clustering methods, the K-means algorithm plays the most important role in clustering because of its simplicity and efficiency. However, it is sensitive to the initial points and easy to fall into local optimum. In order to avoid this kind of flaw, a patented text clustering algorithm Clustering by Genetic Algorithm Model (CGAM) is revealed in this paper. CGAM constructs the fitness function of genetic algorithm (GA) and convergence criterion for K-means algorithm because GA simulates the natural evolutionary process and deals with a larger search space. To tackle the rich semantics of Chinese texts, CGAM creates an innovative selection method of initial centers of GA and accommodates the contribution of characteristics of different parts of speech. Moreover, the impact of outliers is addressed and treated. Its performance is demonstrated by a series of experiments based on both Reuters-21578 and Chinese text corpus. Experimental results show that the CGAM achieves clustering results better than other GA based K-means algorithms and has been successfully applied to national program of business intelligence system in the context of huge set of contents in both Chinese and English.

The disambiguation of a given phrase is applied through a two-stage disambiguation process: (a) The first-stage disambiguation explores the contextual semantic information, where the noisy information is pruned for better effectiveness and efficiency; and (b) the second-stage disambiguation explores the disambiguated phrases of high confidence from the first stage to achieve better redisambiguation decisions for the phrases that are difficult to disambiguate in the first stage. Moreover, existing studies have addressed the disambiguation problem for English text only. Considering the popular usage of Wikipedia in different languages, we study the performance of TSDW and the existing state-of-the-art approaches over both English and Traditional Chinese articles. The experimental results show that TSDW generalizes well to different semantic relatedness measures and text in different languages. More important, TSDW significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with both better effectiveness and efficiency.

To reduce the dimensions of semi-structured texts clustering, aimed at meta-data of semi-structured texts, we build the metadata feature vectors. Based on the domain concepts model, we build domain vector based on the domain concepts tree (set). With the help of the WordNet, we compute semantic similarity between the metadata feature vector and the domain vector. Finally, the clustering algorithm is designed to cluster semi-structured texts based on the semantic similarity between metadata feature vectors and domain vectors. The analysis shows that the clustering algorithm is feasible and has higher clustering accurate rate. It can ease the problem of lacking domain ontology and has the ability to improve the clustering quality. Â© 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

15431;"Mining conceptual rules for web document using sentence ranking conditional probability";0;"Navaneethakumar, V.M.";"Text classification and information mining are two significant objectives of natural language processing. Whereas handcrafting rules for both tasks has an extensive convention, learning strategies increased much attention in the past. Existing work presented concept based mining model for text, sentence mining and does not support text classification. To enhance the text clustering approach, we first presented Conceptual Rule Mining On Text clusters to evaluate the more related and influential sentences contributing the document topic. But this model might discriminate terms with semantic variation and negligible authority on the sentence meaning. In addition, we plan to extend conceptual text clustering to web documents, by assigning sentence weights based on conditional probability. Probability ratio is identified for the sentence similarity from which unique sentence meaning contributing to the document topic are listed. In this work, our plan is to implement ranking of the sentences which are calculated using the weights assigned to each and every sentences. With sentence rank conceptual rules are defined for the text cluster documents. The conceptual rule depicts finer tuned document topic and sentence meaning utilized to evaluate the global document contribution. Experiments are conducted with the web documents extracted from the research repositories to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed efficient conceptual rule mining on web document clusters using sentence ranking conditional probability [CRMSRCP] and compared with an existing Model for Concept Based Clustering and Classification and our previous works in terms of Sentence Term Relation, Cluster Object weights, and cluster quality.

15434;"Recognizing textual entailment in non-English text via automatic translation into English";0;"Pakray, P.a  and Neogi, S.a  and Bandyopadhyay, S.a  and Gelbukh, A.b ";"We show that a task that typically involves rather deep semantic processing of text-being recognizing textual entailment our case study - can be successfully solved without any tools at all specific for the language of the texts on which the task is performed. Instead, we automatically translate the text into English using a standard machine translation system, and then perform all linguistic processing, including syntactic and semantic levels, using only English language linguistic tools. In this case study we use Italian annotated data. Textual entailment is a relation between two texts. To detect it, we use various measures, which allow us to make entailment decision in the two-way classification task (yes / no). We set up various heuristics and measures for evaluating the entailment between two texts based on lexical relations. To make entailment judgments, the system applies named entity recognition module, chunking, part-of-speech tagging, n-grams, and text similarity modules to both texts, all those modules being for English and not for Italian. Rules have been developed to perform the two-way entailment classification. Our system makes entailment judgments basing on the entailment scores for the text pairs. The system was evaluated on Italian textual entailment data sets: we trained our system on Italian development datasets using the WEKA machine learning toolset and tested it on Italian test data sets. The accuracy of our system on the development corpus is 0.525 and on the test corpus is 0.66, which is a good result given that no Italian-specific linguistic information was used.

15445;"Document clustering using the LSI subspace signature model";0;"Zhu, W.Z. and Allen, R.B.";"We describe the latent semantic indexing subspace signature model (LSISSM) for semantic content representation of unstructured text. Grounded on singular value decomposition, the model represents terms and documents by the distribution signatures of their statistical contribution across the top-ranking latent concept dimensions. LSISSM matches term signatures with document signatures according to their mapping coherence between latent semantic indexing (LSI) term subspace and LSI document subspace. LSISSM does feature reduction and finds a low-rank approximation of scalable and sparse term-document matrices. Experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of major clustering algorithms such as standard K-means and self-organizing maps compared with the vector space model and the traditional LSI model. The unique contribution ranking mechanism in LSISSM also improves the initialization of standard K-means compared with random seeding procedure, which sometimes causes low efficiency and effectiveness of clustering. A two-stage initialization strategy based on LSISSM significantly reduces the running time of standard K-means procedures.

15446;"Technology classification with latent semantic indexing";0;"Thorleuchter, D.a  and Van Den Poel, D.b ";"Many national and international governments establish organizations for applied science research funding. For this, several organizations have defined procedures for identifying relevant projects that based on prioritized technologies. Even for applied science research projects, which combine several technologies it is difficult to identify all corresponding technologies of all research-funding organizations. In this paper, we present an approach to support researchers and to support research-funding planners by classifying applied science research projects according to corresponding technologies of research-funding organizations. In contrast to related work, this problem is solved by considering results from literature concerning the application based technological relationships and by creating a new approach that is based on latent semantic indexing (LSI) as semantic text classification algorithm. Technologies that occur together in the process of creating an application are grouped in classes, semantic textual patterns are identified as representative for each class, and projects are assigned to one of these classes. This enables the assignment of each project to all technologies semantically grouped by use of LSI. This approach is evaluated using the example of defense and security based technological research. This is because the growing importance of this application field leads to an increasing number of research projects and to the appearance of many new technologies. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiments examine the relevance of the sentiment features for classification. The ratio of the positive and negative scores, normalized ratio, and average of the positive and negative scores are three sentiment features. The experimental results indicate that the NaÃ¯ve Bayesian classifier using the average of the positive and negative score as sentiment feature, and gain ratio as feature selection criteria achieve 78.27% accuracy based on top 10% of the features. The second best accuracy has been achieved by SVM-based classifiers using the average of the positive and negative score as sentiment feature and top 10% features applying all feature selection criteria except CS.

15458;"Active hashing and its application to image and text retrieval";0;"Zhen, Y. and Yeung, D.-Y.";"In recent years, hashing-based methods for large-scale similarity search have sparked considerable research interests in the data mining and machine learning communities. While unsupervised hashing-based methods have achieved promising successes for metric similarity, they cannot handle semantic similarity which is usually given in the form of labeled point pairs. To overcome this limitation, some attempts have recently been made on semi-supervised hashing which aims at learning hash functions from both metric and semantic similarity simultaneously. Existing semi-supervised hashing methods can be regarded as passive hashing since they assume that the labeled pairs are provided in advance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called active hashing, which can actively select the most informative labeled pairs for hash function learning. Specifically, it identifies the most informative points to label and constructs labeled pairs accordingly. Under this framework, we use data uncertainty as a measure of informativeness and develop a batch mode algorithm to speed up active selection. We empirically compare our method with a state-of-the-art passive hashing method on two benchmark data sets, showing that the proposed method can reduce labeling cost as well as overcome the limitations of passive hashing.

The proposed method treats each time series as a text document, and extracts a set of local patterns from the sequence as words by sliding a short temporal window along the sequence. Motivated by the success of latent topic models in text document analysis, latent topic models are extended to find the underlying structure of time series in an unsupervised manner. The clusters or categories of unlabeled time series are automatically discovered by the latent topic models using bag-of-patterns representation. The proposed method was experimentally validated using two sets of time series data extracted from a public Electrocardiography (ECG) database through comparison with the baseline k-means and the Normalized Cuts approaches. In addition, the impact of the bag-of-patterns parameters was investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised method not only outperforms the baseline k-means and the Normalized Cuts in learning semantic categories of the unlabeled time series, but also is relatively stable with respect to the bag-of-patterns parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to explore latent topic models for unsupervised mining of time series data.

15460;"Machine learning of syntactic parse trees for search and classification of text";0;"Galitsky, B.";"We build an open-source toolkit which implements deterministic learning to support search and text classification tasks. We extend the mechanism of logical generalization towards syntactic parse trees and attempt to detect weak semantic signals from them. Generalization of syntactic parse tree as a syntactic similarity measure is defined as the set of maximum common sub-trees and performed at a level of paragraphs, sentences, phrases and individual words. We analyze semantic features of such similarity measure and compare it with semantics of traditional anti-unification of terms. Nearest-neighbor machine learning is then applied to relate a sentence to a semantic class. Using syntactic parse tree-based similarity measure instead of bag-of-words and keyword frequency approach, we expect to detect a weak semantic signal otherwise unobservable. The proposed approach is evaluated in a four distinct domains where a lack of semantic information makes classification of sentences rather difficult. We describe a toolkit which is a part of Apache Software Foun-dation project OpenNLP, designed to aid search engineers in tasks requiring text relevance assessment. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

15462;"A support vector machine-based context-ranking model for question answering";0;"Yen, S.-J.a  and Wu, Y.-C.b  and Yang, J.-C.c  and Lee, Y.-S.a  and Lee, C.-J.d  and Liu, J.-J.e ";"Modern information technologies and Internet services are suffering from the problem of selecting and managing a growing amount of textual information, to which access is often critical. Machine learning techniques have recently shown excellent performance and flexibility in many applications, such as artificial intelligence and pattern recognition. Question answering (QA) is a method of locating exact answer sentences from vast document collections. This paper presents a machine learning-based question-answering framework, which integrates a question classifier, simple document/passage retrievers, and the proposed context-ranking models. The question classifier is trained to categorize the answer type of the given question and instructs the context-ranking model to re-rank the passages retrieved from the initial retrievers. This method provides flexible features to learners, such as word forms, syntactic features, and semantic word features. The proposed context-ranking model, which is based on the sequential labeling of tasks, combines rich features to predict whether the input passage is relevant to the question type. We employ TREC-QA tracks and question classification benchmarks to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the question classifier achieves 85.60% accuracy without any additional semantic or syntactic taggers, and reached 88.60% after we employed the proposed term expansion techniques and a predefined related-word set. In the TREC-10 QA task, by using the gold TREC-provided relevant document set, the QA model achieves a 0.563 mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score, and a 0.342 MRR score is achieved after using the simple document and passage retrieval algorithms.

15463;"Minimally-supervised extraction of domain-specific part-whole relations using Wikipedia as knowledge-base";0;"Ittoo, A.a  and Bouma, G.b ";"We present a minimally-supervised approach for learning part-whole relations from texts. Unlike previous techniques, we focused on sparse, domain-specific texts. The novelty in our approach lies in the use of Wikipedia as a knowledge-base, from which we first acquire a set of reliable patterns that express part-whole relations. This is achieved by a minimally-supervised algorithm. We then use the patterns acquired to extract part-whole relation triples from a collection of sparse, domain-specific texts. Our strategy, of learning in one domain and applying the knowledge in another domain is based upon the notion of domain-adaption. It allows us to overcome the challenges of learning the relations directly from the sparse, domain-specific corpus. Our experimental evaluations reveal that, despite its general-purpose nature, Wikipedia can be exploited as a source of knowledge for improving the performance of domain-specific part-whole relation extraction. As our other contributions, we propose a mechanism that mitigates the negative impact of semantic-drift on minimally-supervised algorithms. Also, we represent the patterns in the extracted relations using sophisticated syntactic structures that avoid the limitations of traditional surface string representations. In addition, we show that domain-specific part-whole relations cannot be conclusively classified in existing taxonomies. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

15466;"An automatic approach for ontology-based feature extraction from heterogeneous textual resources";0;"Vicient, C. and SÃ¡nchez, D. and Moreno, A.";"Data mining algorithms such as data classification or clustering methods exploit features of entities to characterise, group or classify them according to their resemblance. In the past, many feature extraction methods focused on the analysis of numerical or categorical properties. In recent years, motivated by the success of the Information Society and the WWW, which has made available enormous amounts of textual electronic resources, researchers have proposed semantic data classification and clustering methods that exploit textual data at a conceptual level. To do so, these methods rely on pre-annotated inputs in which text has been mapped to their formal semantics according to one or several knowledge structures (e.g. ontologies, taxonomies). Hence, they are hampered by the bottleneck introduced by the manual semantic mapping process. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a domain-independent, automatic and unsupervised method to detect relevant features from heterogeneous textual resources, associating them to concepts modelled in a background ontology. The method has been applied to raw text resources and also to semi-structured ones (Wikipedia articles). It has been tested in the Tourism domain, showing promising results. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the approach, we investigate two strategies to select and filter Wikipedia articles for the category representation. Besides, a probabilistic model is employed to compute the semantic relatedness between two concepts in Wikipedia. Experimental evaluation using manually labeled ground truth shows that our proposed Wiki3C can achieve a noticeable improvement over the baselines without considering contextual information.

15468;"Group sparse topical coding: From code to topic";0;"Bai, L. and Guo, J. and Lan, Y. and Cheng, X.";"Learning low dimensional representations of text corpora is critical in many content analysis and data mining applications. It is even more desired and challenging to learn a sparse representation in practice for large scale text modeling. However, traditional probabilistic topic models (PTM) lack a mechanism to directly control the posterior sparsity of the inferred representations; While the emerged non-probabilistic models (NPM) can explicitly control sparsity using sparse constraint like l-1 norm, they convey different limitations in latent representations. To address the existing problems, we propose a novel non-probabilistic topic model for discovering sparse latent representations of large text corpora, referred as group sparse topical coding (GSTC). Our model enjoys both the merits of the PTMs and NPMs. On one hand, GSTC can naturally derive document-level admixture proportions in topic simplex like PTMs, which is useful for semantic analysis, classification or retrieval. On the other hand, GSTC can directly control the sparsity of the inferred representations with group lasso by relaxing the normalization constraint. Moreover, the relaxed non-probabilistic GSTC can be effectively learned using coordinate descent method. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GSTC can discover meaningful compact latent representations of documents, and improve the document classification accuracy and time efficiency.

15475;"QuenchML: A semantics-preserving markup language for knowledge representation in quenching";0;"Varde, A.S.a  and Maniruzzaman, M.b  and Sisson Jr., R.D.c ";"Knowledge representation (KR) is an important area in artificial intelligence (AI) and is often related to specific domains. The representation of knowledge in domain-specific contexts makes it desirable to capture semantics as domain experts would. This motivates the development of semantics-preserving standards for KR within the given domain. In addition to the storage and analysis of information using such standards, the effect of globalization today necessitates the publishing of information on the Web. Thus, it is advisable to use formats that make the information easily publishable and accessible while developing KR standards. In this article, we propose such a standard called Quenching Markup Language (QuenchML). This follows the syntax of the eXtensible Markup Language and captures the semantics of the quenching domain within the heat treating of materials. We describe the development of QuenchML, a multidisciplinary effort spanning the realms of AI, database management, and materials science, considering various aspects such as ontology, data modeling, and domain-specific constraints. We also explain the usefulness of QuenchML in semantics-preserving information retrieval and in text mining guided by domain knowledge. Furthermore, we outline the significance of this work in software tools within the field of AI.

To improve the classification of medical assertions, we propose several new features that capture the semantic properties of special cue words highly indicative of a specific assertion category.

15477;"BRES: Extracting multiclass biomedical relations with semantic network";0;"Gong, L.a  b  and Yang, R.a  and Sun, X.b ";"With an overwhelming amount of published biomedical research, the underlying biomedical knowledge is expanding at an exponential rate. This expansion makes it very difficult to find interested genetics knowledge. And therefore, there is an urgent need for developing text mining approaches to discover new knowledge from publications. This paper presents a text mining approach for multiclass biomedical relations based on predicate argument structure (PAS) and shallow parsing. The approach can mine explicit biomedical relations with semantic enrichment, and visualize relations with semantic network. It first identifies noun phrases based on shallow parsing, and then filters arguments from noun phrases via biomedical ontology dictionary. We have implemented BRES, a text mining system, based on our proposed approach. Our results obtained 67.7% F-measure, 62.5% precision and 73.8% recall for the test dataset.

15478;"Abstracting for dimensionality reduction in text classification";0;"McAllister, R.A. and Angryk, R.A.";"There is a growing interest in efficient models of text mining and an emergent need for new data structures that address word relationships. Detailed knowledge about the taxonomic environment of keywords that are used in text documents can provide valuable insight into the nature of the subject matter contained therein. Such insight may be used to enhance the data structures used in the text data mining task as relationships become usefully apparent. A popular scalable technique used to infer these relationships, while reducing dimensionality, has been Latent Semantic Analysis. We present a new approach, which uses an ontology of lexical abstractions to create abstraction profiles of documents and uses these profiles to perform text organization based on a process that we call frequent abstraction analysis. We introduce TATOO, the Text Abstraction TOOlkit, which is a full implementation of this new approach. We present our data model via an example of how taxonomically derived abstractions can be used to supplement semantic data structures for the text classification task.

15480;"Semantic similarity of ontology instances using polarity mining";0;"Narock, T.a  and Zhou, L.a  and Yoon, V.b ";"Semantic similarity is vital to many areas, such as information retrieval. Various methods have been proposed with a focus on comparing unstructured text documents. Several of these have been enhanced with ontology; however, they have not been applied to ontology instances. With the growth in ontology instance data published online through, for example, Linked Open Data, there is an increasing need to apply semantic similarity to ontology instances. Drawing on ontology-supported polarity mining (OSPM), we propose an algorithm that enhances the computation of semantic similarity with polarity mining techniques. The algorithm is evaluated with online customer review data. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm in multiple settings.

15481;"A human-computer collaborative approach to identifying common data elements in clinical trial eligibility criteria";0;"Luo, Z.a  b  and Miotto, R.a  and Weng, C.a ";"Objective: To identify Common Data Elements (CDEs) in eligibility criteria of multiple clinical trials studying the same disease using a human-computer collaborative approach. Design: A set of free-text eligibility criteria from clinical trials on two representative diseases, breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases, was sampled to identify disease-specific eligibility criteria CDEs. In this proposed approach, a semantic annotator is used to recognize Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLSs) terms within the eligibility criteria text. The Apriori algorithm is applied to mine frequent disease-specific UMLS terms, which are then filtered by a list of preferred UMLS semantic types, grouped by similarity based on the Dice coefficient, and, finally, manually reviewed. Measurements: Standard precision, recall, and F-score of the CDEs recommended by the proposed approach were measured with respect to manually identified CDEs. Results: Average precision and recall of the recommended CDEs for the two diseases were 0.823 and 0.797, respectively, leading to an average F-score of 0.810. In addition, the machine-powered CDEs covered 80% of the cardiovascular CDEs published by The American Heart Association and assigned by human experts. Conclusion: It is feasible and effort saving to use a human-computer collaborative approach to augment domain experts for identifying disease-specific CDEs from free-text clinical trial eligibility criteria.

15491;"Text categorization based on regularization extreme learning machine";0;"Zheng, W.a  b  and Qian, Y.a  and Lu, H.b ";"This article proposes a novel approach for text categorization based on a regularization extreme learning machine (RELM) in which its weights can be obtained analytically, and a bias-variance trade-off could be achieved by adding a regularization term into the linear system of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks. To fit the input scale of RELM, the latent semantic analysis was used to represent text for dimensionality reduction. Moreover, a classification algorithm based on RELM was developed including the uni-label (i. e., a document can only be assigned to a unique category) and multi-label (i. e., a document can be assigned to multiple categories simultaneously) situations. The experimental results in two benchmarks show that the proposed method can produce good performance in most cases, and it could learn faster than popular methods such as feedforward neural networks or support vector machine.

NMiner takes advantage of heuristics to find answers to complex semantic queries. It uses a combination of natural language processing techniques to parse sentences and extract entities, hypertext structure of the documents to derive relational information, and semantic web data to extract relevant entities as search result candidates. Further, a bimodal network of sentences and entities is created from the search result candidates. Content Centric Ranking (CCR) and Cumulative Structural Similarity (CSS), are proposed to rank the candidate entities. Our empirical study on the ClueWeb09 corpus (with approximately 25 terabytes of web documents) shows that both CSS and CCR outperform PageRank and HITS. Moreover, NMiner proved to be significant in solving the problem of answering complex queries performed against a largely unstructured corpus of text documents.

In this work, we claim that image analysis techniques can ""return the favor"" to the text processing community and be successfully used for a general-purpose representation of word meaning. We provide evidence that simple low-level visual features can enrich the semantic representation of word meaning with information that cannot be extracted from text alone, leading to improvement in the core task of estimating degrees of semantic relatedness between words, as well as providing a new, perceptually-enhanced angle on word semantics. Additionally, we show how distinguishing between a concept and its context in images can improve the quality of the word meaning representations extracted from images.

Identifying such relationships help in reducing the difference between related documents. In this work, we use only noun terms for enriching the representation model. The natural visualization of clusters is investigated in this study using Emergent Self Organizing Map (ESOM).

15499;"SemaFor: Semantic document indexing using semantic forests";0;"Tsatsaronis, G.a  and Varlamis, I.b  and NÃ¸rvÃ¥g, K.c ";"Traditional document indexing techniques store documents using easily accessible representations, such as inverted indices, which can efficiently scale for large document sets. These structures offer scalable and efficient solutions in text document management tasks, though, they omit the cornerstone of the documents purpose: meaning. They also neglect semantic relations that bind terms into coherent fragments of text that convey messages. When semantic representations are employed, the documents are mapped to the space of concepts and the similarity measures are adapted appropriately to better fit the retrieval tasks. However, these methods can be slow both at indexing and retrieval time. In this paper we propose SemaFor, an indexing algorithm for text documents, which uses semantic spanning forests constructed from lexical resources, like Wikipedia, and WordNet, and spectral graph theory in order to represent documents for further processing.

Previous works on applications such as data integration, query expansion, tag refactoring or text clustering have used some semantic similarity measures in the past. Despite the usefulness of semantic similarity measures in these applications, the problem of measuring the similarity between two text expressions remains a key challenge. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach - In this article, the authors propose an optimization environment to improve existing techniques that use the notion of co-occurrence and the information available on the web to measure similarity between terms. Findings - The experimental results using the Miller and Charles and Gracia and Mena benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach is able to outperform classic probabilistic web-based algorithms by a wide margin. Originality/value - This paper presents two main contributions. The authors propose a novel technique that beats classic probabilistic techniques for measuring semantic similarity between terms. This new technique consists of using not only a search engine for computing web page counts, but a smart combination of several popular web search engines.

15502;"On topic categorization of PubMed query results";0;"Kanavos, A.a  and Makris, C.a  and Theodoridis, E.a  b ";"Nowadays, people frequently use search engines in order to find the information they need on the Web. Especially Web search constitutes a basic tool used by million researchers in their everyday work. A very popular indexing engine, concerning life sciences and biomedical research is PubMed. PubMed is a free database accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. The present search engines usually return search results in a global ranking making it difficult to the users to browse in different topics or subtopics that they query. Because of this mixing of results belonging to different topics, the average users spend a lot of time to find Web pages, best matching their query. In this paper, we propose a novel system to address this problem. We present and evaluate a methodology that exploits semantic text clustering techniques in order to group biomedical document collections in homogeneous topics. In order to provide more accurate clustering results, we utilize various biomedical ontologies, like MeSH and GeneOntology. Finally, we embed the proposed methodology in an online system that post-processes the PubMed online database in order to provide to users the retrieved results according to well formed topics.

However, one of the main problems is that while building ontologies, the main effort is put to the construction of the conceptual part, whereas the lexical aspects of ontologies are usually diminished. Therefore, analyzing texts, it is usually difficult to map words to concepts from the ontology. Usually one should consider various linguistic relationships, such as homonymy, synonymy, etc. However, they are not clearly reflected in the conceptual part. We propose LEXO - a special lexical layer, which is thought as a bridge between text and the conceptual core of the ontology. LEXO is dedicated to storing linguistic relationships along with textual evidence for the relationships (as discovered in the text mining process). In addition, we present an algorithm based on LEXO for determining meaning of a given term in an analyzed text.

15505;"Improved multilevel security with latent semantic indexing";0;"Thorleuchter, D.a  and Van Den Poel, D.b ";"Multilevel security (MLS) is specifically created to protect information from unauthorized access. In MLS, documents are assigned to a security label by a trusted subject e.g. an authorized user and based on this assignment; the access to documents is allowed or denied. Using a large number of security labels lead to a complex administration in MLS based operating systems. This is because the manual assignment of documents to a large number of security labels by an authorized user is time-consuming and error-prone. Thus in practice, most MLS based operating systems use a small number of security labels. However, information that is normally processed in an organization consists of different sensitivities and belongs to different compartments. To depict this information in MLS, a large number of security labels is necessary. The aim of this paper is to show that the use of latent semantic indexing is successful in assigning textual information to security labels.

15507;"Using webcrawling of publicly-available websites to assess e-commerce relationships";0;"Thorleuchter, D.a  and Van Den Poel, D.b ";"We investigate e-commerce success factors concerning their impact on the success of commerce transactions between businesses companies. In scientific literature, many e-commerce success factors are introduced. Most of them are focused on companies website quality. They are evaluated concerning companies success in the business to consumer (B2C) environment where consumers choose their preferred e-commerce websites based on these success factors e.g. website content quality, website interaction, and website customization. In contrast to previous work, this research focuses on the usage of existing e-commerce success factors for predicting successfulness of business-to-business (B2B) ecommerce. The introduced methodology is based on the identification of semantic textual patterns representing success factors from the websites of B2B companies. The successfulness of the identified success factors in B2B ecommerce is evaluated by regression modeling. As a result, it is shown that some B2C e-commerce success factors also enable the predicting of B2B e-commerce success while others do not. This contributes to the existing literature concerning ecommerce success factors. Further, these findings are valuable for B2B e-commerce websites creation.

15510;"Context similarity measure using fuzzy formal concept analysis";0;"Selvi, K.a  and Suresh, R.M.b ";"In information retrieval, one of the main problems is to retrieve a set of documents that is semantically related to a given user query. Efficient estimation of semantic similarity between words is critical for various natural language processing tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), textual entailment and automatic text summarization. We propose an empirical method to estimate semantic similarity using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis. Grouping the different lexical patterns enable us to represent a semantic relation between two words accurately. Specifically, we define various word cooccurrence measures using page counts and integrate those with lexical patterns extracted from text snippets. To identify the numerous semantic relations that exist between two given words, we propose a novel pattern extraction algorithm and a pattern clustering algorithm. The optimal combination of page counts-based co-occurrence measures and lexical pattern clusters is learned using support vector machines. The proposed method outperforms various baselines and previously proposed web-based semantic similarity measures on three benchmark data sets showing a high correlation with human ratings. Moreover, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in a community mining task.

In order to accomplish feature reduction, the filter method named term filtering for independent topic features is proposed to compress each topic feature vector. We introduce the created food ontology as background knowledge and to expand the semantic of complaint documents with the aid of HowNet. So we can supplement effective information and improve the effect of text classification. In addition, we take account of different importance between title and body in the text, considering that title can stand out the topic of text better than the textual body. Consequently, we separately calculate the word frequency which words are in textual title and body. The experiments show that it is necessary to consider the different importance between textual title and body, and we can achieve good feature reduction effect using the proposed filter method, and the classification performance get obvious improvement after the process of term expanding.

15517;"Adding intelligence to non-corpus based word sense disambiguation";0;"Charhate, S.a  and Dani, A.a  and Sugandhi, R.b  and Patil, V.c ";"Natural language processing applications invariably perform word sense disambiguation as one of its processing steps. The accuracy of sense disambiguation depends upon an efficient algorithm as well as a reliable knowledge-base in the form of annotated corpus and/or dictionaries in machine readable form. Algorithms working on corpus for sense disambiguation are generally employed as supervised machine learning systems. But such systems need ample training on the corpus before being applied on the actual data set. This paper discusses an unsupervised approach of a graph-based technique that solely works on a machine-readable dictionary as the knowledge source. This approach can improve the bottleneck problem that persists in corpus-based word sense disambiguation. The method described here attempts to make the algorithm more intelligent by considering various WordNet semantic relations and auto-filtration of content words before graph generation.

Existing methods are effective to demonstrate content, but are not capable of preserving semantic relationships among keywords while still linking the word cloud to the underlying document groups that generated them. Such representation is highly desirable for exploratory analysis of document collections. In this paper we present a novel approach to build document clouds, named ProjCloud that aim at solving both semantical layouts and linking with document sets. ProjCloud generates a semantically consistent layout from a set of documents. Through a multidimensional projection, it is possible to visualize the neighborhood relationship between highly related documents and their corresponding word clouds simultaneously. Additionally, we propose a new algorithm for building word clouds inside polygons, which employs spectral sorting to maintain the semantic relationship among words. The effectiveness and flexibility of our methodology is confirmed when comparisons are made to existing methods. The technique automatically constructs projection based layouts the user may choose to examine in the form of the point clouds or corresponding word clouds, allowing a high degree of control over the exploratory process.

15522;"Classification of RSS feed news items using ontology";0;"Agarwal, S. and Singhal, A. and Bedi, P.";"Explosive growth of data on the web demand techniques, which would enable the user to access desired information. In Information retrieval Document Classification is prerequisite. In practice many classification techniques were and are in use. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is an approach which represents documents based on the frequency of terms in documents. Limitation of this approach is high dimensionality of data. Moreover it does not consider the relations among the terms, resulting in less precise and noisy end result. In our approach we are using weighted Concept Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CF-IDF) with background knowledge of domain Ontology, for classification of RSS feed News Items. Metadata information of news items has been used to assign weight to the identified concepts. No trained classifiers are required as Ontology itself acts as a classifier. We have designed ontology based on news industry standards. This classification approach considers relations among the concepts and properties. It results in reduction of noise in final output. It considers only the key concepts of a domain for classification instead of all the terms, which curbs the problem of dimensionality. Evaluation of experimental results reveals that proposed approach gives better classification results.

15525;"Towards comprehensive longitudinal healthcare data capture";0;"Cameron, D.a  and Bhagwan, V.b  and Sheth, A.P.a ";"The ability to connect the dots in structured background knowledge and also across scientific literature has been demonstrated as a critical aspect of knowledge discovery. It is not unreasonable therefore to expect that connecting-the-dots across massive amounts of healthcare data may also lead to new insights that could impact diagnosis, treatment and overall patient care. Of critical importance is the observation that while structured Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are useful sources of health information, it is often the unstructured clinical texts such as progress notes and discharge summaries that contain rich, updated and granular information. Hence, by coupling structured EMR data with data from unstructured clinical texts, more holistic patient records, needed for connecting the dots, can be obtained. Unfortunately, free-text progress notes are fraught with a lack of proper grammatical structure, and contain liberal use of jargon and abbreviations, together with frequent misspellings. While these notes still serve their intended purpose for medical care, automatically extracting semantic information from them is a complex task. Overcoming this complexity could mean that evidence-based support for structured EMR data using unstructured clinical texts, can be provided. In this work therefore, we explore a pattern-based approach for extracting Smoker Semantic Types (SST) from unstructured clinical notes, in order to enable evidence-based resolution of SSTs asserted in structured EMRs using SSTs extracted from unstructured clinical notes. Our findings support the notion that information present in unstructured clinical text can be used to complement structured healthcare data. This is a crucial observation towards creating comprehensive longitudinal patient models for connecting-the-dots and providing better overall patient care.

15526;"WNavi s: Navigating Wikipedia semantically with an SNA-based summarization technique";0;"Wu, I.-C. and Lin, Y.-S.";"Link-based applications like Wikipedia are becoming increasingly popular because they provide users with an efficient way to find needed knowledge, such as searching for definitions and information about a particular topic, and exploring articles on related topics. This work introduces a semantics-based navigation application called WNavi s, to facilitate information-seeking activities in internal link-based websites in Wikipedia. WNavi s is based on the theories and techniques of link mining, semantic relatedness analysis and text summarization. Our goal is to develop an application that helps users find related articles for a seed query (topic) easily and then quickly check the content of articles to explore a new concept or topic in Wikipedia. Technically, we construct a preliminary topic network by analyzing the internal links of Wikipedia and applying the normalized Google distance algorithm to quantify the strength of the semantic relationships between articles via key terms. Because not all the content of articles in Wikipedia is relevant to users information needs, it is desirable to locate specific information for users and enable them to quickly explore and read topic-related articles. Accordingly, we propose an SNA-based single and multiple-document summarization technique that can extract meaningful sentences from articles. We applied a number of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods to demonstrate the efficacy of the summarization techniques in terms of precision, and recall. The results suggest that the proposed summarization technique is effective. Our findings have implications for the design of a navigation tool that can help users explore related articles in Wikipedia quickly. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

15530;"Efficient classification using phrases generated by topic models";0;"Gujraniya, D. and Murty, M.N.";"There are many popular models available for classification of documents like NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine. In all these cases, the representation is based on the Bag of words model. This model doesnt capture the actual semantic meaning of a word in a particular document.

15537;"Identifying accuracy of social tags by using clustering representations of song lyrics";0;"Hu, Y. and Ogihara, M.";"Social tags have been acknowledged as a highly useful resource in retrieving music by moods or topics. However, since social tags are open for labeling, some social tags are inaccurate. In this paper, we present a new framework to identify accurate social tags of songs. In our framework, we first clean and filter music tags. Then we apply an improved hierarchical clustering algorithm to group the tags to build a tag category. Based on the category, we classify music songs using lyrics. In order to extend the semantic information of lyrics, we apply CLOPE to cluster lyrics and use the centroid of the corresponding cluster to represent the lyrics. Based on the Na\ive Bayes method, the probability of assigning lyrics to particular class is predicted. The classification result is then used to determine whether a social tag is accurate. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective and encouraging.

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised context-based approach to detecting emotion from text at the sentence level. The proposed methodology does not depend on any existing manually crafted affect lexicons such as Word Net-Affect, thereby rendering our model flexible enough to classify sentences beyond Ekmans model of six basic emotions. Our method computes an emotion vector for each potential affect bearing word based on the semantic relatedness between words and various emotion concepts. The scores are then fine tuned using the syntactic dependencies within the sentence structure. Extensive evaluation on various data sets shows that our framework is a more generic and practical solution to the emotion classification problem and yields significantly more accurate results than recent unsupervised approaches.

The rapid computerization of cars makes it increasingly important to capitalize on these sources and exploit others. The present study explores a rarely analyzed data source on traffic fatalities: National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations vehicle owners complaint database. The textual data within the event description field of each complaint is extracted and analyzed using a text mining approach that involves the use of latent semantic analysis (LSA) for reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Hierarchical clustering is then employed to identify clusters of complaints that share content. Clusters are described in terms of the most frequent terms and the time trends of the complaints within them. The analysis highlights how text mining analysis can help unlock the wealth of information contained in consumer complaint databases. Copyright 2012 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc.

15549;"Exploiting semantic resources for large scale text categorization";0;"Li, J.Q. and Zhao, Y. and Liu, B.";"The traditional supervised classifier for Text Categorization (TC) is learned from a set of hand-labeled documents. However, the task of manual data labeling is labor intensive and time consuming, especially for a complex TC task with hundreds or thousands of categories. To address this issue, many semi-supervised methods have been reported to use both labeled and unlabeled documents for TC. But they still need a small set of labeled data for each category. In this paper, we propose a Fully Automatic Categorization approach for Text (FACT), where no manual labeling efforts are required. In FACT, the lexical databases serve as semantic resources for category name understanding. It combines the semantic analysis of category names and statistic analysis of the unlabeled document set for fully automatic training data construction. With the support of lexical databases, we first use the category name to generate a set of features as a representative profile for the corresponding category. Then, a set of documents is labeled according to the representative profile. To reduce the possible bias originating from the category name and the representative profile, document clustering is used to refine the quality of initial labeling. The training data are subsequently constructed to train the discriminative classifier. The empirical experiments show that one variant of our FACT approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised TC approach significantly. It can achieve more than 90% of F1 performance of the baseline SVM methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Through exploiting these representations we propose a logical model and architecture by which cross-domain researchers can more easily discover, use, and eventually archive, data. In this paper we present an architecture, intermediate data model, and methodology for mapping diverse social-ecological data sources stored in relational databases to a common representation, and for classifying textual data using machine learning.

To overcome the defect of traditional keywords which does not take into account the semantic relation between keywords, FHAR algorithm in the paper is based on concept vector. The density of semantic field and the weight of meaning are used to determine the concept of the keywords, which not only adds the texts semantic, but also reduces vector dimensions; FHAR algorithm adopts improved HASH table for efficient large itemset generation. The stored address of itemsets is determined by a new hash function. Based on the new hash table, tree structure is constructed.

15556;"Semantic graph reduction approach for abstractive Text Summarization";0;"Moawad, I.F.a  and Aref, M.b ";"One of the important Natural Language Processing applications is Text Summarization, which helps users to manage the vast amount of information available, by condensing documents content and extracting the most relevant facts or topics included. Text Summarization can be classified according to the type of summary: extractive, and abstractive. Extractive summary is the procedure of identifying important sections of the text and producing them verbatim while abstractive summary aims to produce important material in a new generalized form. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to create an abstractive summary for a single document using a rich semantic graph reducing technique. The approach summaries the input document by creating a rich semantic graph for the original document, reducing the generated graph, and then generating the abstractive summary from the reduced graph. Besides, a simulated case study is presented to show how the original text was minimized to fifty percent.

Hypothesizing that patterns of neural activation might be reflected in the latent semantics of words, we apply hierarchical clustering and network graph analysis to quantify the interaction of emotion and motion related action verbs based on two large-scale text corpora. Comparing the word topologies to neural networks we suggest that the co-activation of associated word forms in the brain resemble the latent semantics of action verbs, which may in turn reflect parameters of force and spatial differentiation underlying action based language.

In the task, texts are transformed into vectors of radicals, characters and words. Radicals are further pruned by their semantic strengths and network traits. We carry out experiments with real data from Open Directory Project. The experiments results justify Chinese radicals as important features for semantic processing in Chinese text mining tasks.

15563;"Principal component analysis neural network for textual document categorization and dimension reduction";0;"Jaffali, S. and Jamoussi, S.";"This manuscript presents the study and application of the method of principal component analysis (PCA) in the field of text mining. We began by studying the theoretical basis behind this method and we have focused on two of its variants namely the neural PCA and kernel PCA. We used neural PCA for automatic categorization of text documents through an extraction of semantic concepts. The second contribution of our work is the use of PCA (neuronal and kernel) for the dimension reduction of textual documents through the automatic classification.

15565;"Stemming versus Light Stemming for measuring the simitilarity between Arabic Words with Latent Semantic Analysis model";0;"Froud, H.a  and Lachkar, A.a  and Ouatik, S.A.b ";"Representation of semantic information contained in the words is needed for any Arabic Text Mining applications. More precisely, the purpose is to better take into account the semantic dependencies between words expressed by the co-occurrence frequencies of these words. There have been many proposals to compute similarities between words based on their distributions in contexts. In this paper, we compare and contrast the effect of two preprocessing techniques applied to Arabic corpus: Stemming, and Light Stemming techniques for measuring the semantic between Arabic words with the well known abstractive model -Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)- with a wide variety of distance functions and similarity measures, such as the Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Coefficient, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The obtained results show that, on the one hand, the variety of the corpus produces more accurate results; on the other hand, the Light Stemming outperformed the Stemming approach because Stemming affects the words meanings.

15566;"Non-negative Sparse Semantic Coding for text categorization";0;"Zheng, W. and Qian, Y.";"In text categorization, the dimensionality reduction methods, such as latent semantic indexing and nonnegative matrix factorization, commonly yield the dense representation that is not consistent with our common knowledge. On the other hand, the popular sparse coding methods are time-consuming and their dictionaries might contain negative entries, which is difficulty to interpret the semantic meaning of text. This paper proposes a novel Non-negative Sparse Semantic Coding (NSSC) approach for text reprentation. NSSC provides an efficient algorithm to construct a set of non-negative basis vectors that span a low dimensional semantic subspace, where each document obtains a non-negative sparse representation corresponding to these basis vectors. Extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed approach achieves a good performance and presents more interpretability with respect to these semantic concepts.

Event-based extractive summarization attempts to extract sentences and re-organize them in a summary according to the important events that the sentences describe. Events are defined by the event terms and the associated entities at the sentence level. In this paper, we emphasize on the event semantic relations derived from external linguistic resource. Firstly, the graph based on the event semantic relations is constructed and the events in the graph are grouped into clusters using the revised DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Then, we select one event as the representative event for each cluster or one cluster to present the main topic of the documents. Lastly, we generate the summary by extracting the sentences which contain more informative representative events from the documents.

This conceptualization is realized by mapping terms that are extracted from text to their corresponding concepts in the UMLS® Metathesaurus® in order to take meaning into consideration during text classification. The proposed classifier is tested on the Ohsumed text corpus, which is composed of abstracts of biomedical articles retrieved from the MEDLINEÂ® database.

15578;"Least information document representation for automated text classification";0;"Ke, W.";"We propose the Least Information theory (LIT) to quantify meaning of information in probability distributions and derive a new document representation model for text classification. By extending Shannon entropy to accommodate a non-linear relation between information and uncertainty, LIT offers an information-centric approach to weight terms based on probability distributions in documents vs. in the collection. We develop two term weight quantities in the document classification context: 1) LI Binary (LIB) which quantifies (least) information due to the observation of a terms (binary) occurrence in a document; and 2) LI Frequency (LIF) which measures information for the observation of a randomly picked term from the document. Both quantities are computed given term distributions in the document collection as prior knowledge and can be used separately or combined to represent documents for text classification. We conduct classification experiments on three benchmark collections, in which the proposed methods show strong performances compared to classic TF IDF. Particularly, the LIB LIF weighting scheme, which combines LIB and LIF, outperforms TF IDF in several experimental settings. Despite its similarity to TF IDF, the formulation of LIB LIF is very different and offers a new way of thinking for modeling information processes beyond classification.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";33;"2012";"Proceedings of the ASIST Annual Meeting";;"Article";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84878587212&partnerID=40&md5=d76a886949e29ce6eeab34dab34fac86";"49";;;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"01/07/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"representacao textual";"null";"null";"null";"null";"classificacao";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Propostas de medidas comparadas a TFIDF";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

Specifically, this work has two main goals: (1) to detect the associated weight of word word pairs, and (2) to provide an understanding of a lexical network formed beyond an input-output word pair, similar to the mediated priming effect reported experimentally. We used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting (TFIDF) to obtain the associated weight between an input output word pair and to calculate the TFIDF-Matrix which is used as an input in the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Model. The LSA model is a semantic representation at the lexical level that allows us to understand semantic relationships beyond input-output word pairs.

15581;"A feature selection method for improved document classification";0;"Basu, T. and Murthy, C.A.";"The aim of text document classification is to automatically group a document to a predefined class. The main problem of document classification is high dimensionality and sparsity of the data matrix. A new feature selection technique using the google distance have been proposed in this article to effectively obtain a feature subset which improves the classification accuracy. Normalized google distance can automatically extract the meaning of terms from the world wide web. It utilizes the advantage of number of hits returned by the google search engine to compute the semantic relation between two terms. In the proposed approach, only the distance function of google distance is used to develop a relation between a feature and a class for document classification and it is independent of google search results. Every feature will generate a score based on their relation with all the classes and then all the features will be ranked accordingly. The experimental results are presented using knn classifier on several TREC and Reuter data sets. Precision, recall, f-measure and classification accuracy are used to analyze the results. The proposed method is compared with four other feature selection methods for document classification, document frequency thresholding, information gain, mutual information and Ï‡2 statistic. The empirical studies have shown that the proposed method have effectively done feature selection in most of the cases with either an improvement or no change of classification accuracy.

Tweets can be analyzed automatically in order to derive much potential information such as, interesting topics, social influence, users communities, etc. Community extraction within social networks has been a focus of recent work in several areas. Different from the most community discovery methods focused on the relations between users, we aim to derive users communities based on common topics from users tweets. For instance, if two users always talk about politic in their tweets, thus they can be grouped in the same community which is related to politic topic. To achieve this goal, we propose a new approach called CETD: Community Extraction based on Topic-Driven-Model. This approach combines our proposed model used to detect topics of the users tweets based on a semantic taxonomy together with a community extraction method based on the hierarchical clustering technique. Our experimentation on the proposed approach shows the relevant of the users communities extracted based on their common topics and domains.

The practical success of these systems significantly depends on the correctness and quality of the extracted semantic tuples. The quality and correctness of the semantic predictions can be measured against a benchmark semantic structure. In this article, we presented an approach for constructing a reference semantic tuple structure based on the existing biomedical knowledge sources in which the evaluation is based on the UMLS knowledge sources. In the evaluation, 7400 semantic triples are extracted from UMLS knowledge sources and the semantic predictions are constructed using the proposed approach. In the semantic triples, 87 concepts are found redundantly classified and 207 pair of semantic triples showed hierarchically inconsistent. 128 are found to be non-taxonomically inconsistent. The quality of the semantic triple is also judged using expert evaluators. The Cohens kappa coefficient is used to measure the degree of agreement between two evaluators and the result is promising (0.9).

These features cannot indicate semantic or textual content; it results in huge feature space and semantic loss. The proposed model in this work adopts a ""topics"" sampled by LDA model as text features. It effectively avoids the above problems. We extracted significant themes (topics) of all texts, each theme is described by a particular distribution of descriptors, then each text is represented on the vectors of these topics. Experiments are conducted using an in-house corpus of Arabic texts. Precision, recall and F-measure are used to quantify categorization effectiveness.

The NaÃ¯ve Bayes and SVM approaches were implemented in multiple folds. The results, in addition to presenting a detailed comparative view of these techniques, demonstrate that with suitable selection of features the Naive Bayes algorithm performs reasonably well and at times matches the popularly believed superior performance level of SVM, at least for sentiment analysis task. The SO-PMI-IR algorithm produces substantially accurate sentiment classification without the requirement of any prior training.

15600;"An interests discovery approach in social networks based on semantically enriched graphs";0;"Al-Kouz, A. and Albayrak, S.";"Studying the text messages of a user such as his posts in Facebook or his tweets in Twitter can help in detecting his topics of interests. User in Social Network Systems (SNS) posts text messages about a wide diverse of topics. Posts usually written in a non-standard language, which make it not applicable to the standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques used to catch the relations between words in text. In many cases there are semantic relations between the contained entities of posts that can infer the interest of the user. Bag-Of-Words (BOW) based text classification techniques classify this kind of messages to a wide diverse of topics, but they fail in catching the implicit semantic relation between the contained entities. In this paper we propose a technique to discover the implicit semantic relations between entities in text messages, which can infer the interests of a user. The proposed technique based on a semantically enriched graph representation of entities contained in text messages generated by a user, a new algorithm (Root-Path-Degree) is invented and used to find the most representative sub-graph that reflects the semantic implicit interests of the user.

15608;"Chatting pattern based game BOT detection: Do they talk like us?";0;"Kang, A.R. and Kim, H.K. and Woo, J.";"Among the various security threats in online games, the use of game bots is the most serious problem. Previous studies on game bot detection have proposed many methods to find out discriminable behaviors of bots from humans based on the fact that a bots playing pattern is different from that of a human. In this paper, we look at the chatting data that reflects gamers communication patterns and propose a communication pattern analysis framework for online game bot detection. In massive multi-user online role playing games (MMORPGs), game bots use chatting message in a different way from normal users. We derive four features; a network feature, a descriptive feature, a diversity feature and a text feature. To measure the diversity of communication patterns, we propose lightly summarized indices, which are computationally inexpensive and intuitive. For text features, we derive lexical, syntactic and semantic features from chatting contents using text mining techniques. To build the learning model for game bot detection, we test and compare three classification models: the random forest, logistic regression and lazy learning. We apply the proposed framework to AION operated by NCsoft, a leading online game company in Korea. As a result of our experiments, we found that the random forest outperforms the logistic regression and lazy learning. The model that employs the entire feature sets gives the highest performance with a precision value of 0.893 and a recall value of 0.965.

Ontology matching is a technique that helps to identify the correspondences on the description schemas of different sources and provide the basis for interesting applications that exploit the information in a linked fashion. The present paper presents a data-driven approach for discovering matches between different classification schemas. The approach is based on content analysis and linguistic processing in order to extract information in the form of relation tuples, use the extracted information to associate the content of different repositories and match their underlying classification schemas based on the degree of content similarity. The preliminary results verified the validity of the approach, as both experiments produced a semantically valid matching in 68% of the examined classes. The results also exposed the need for refinements on the linguistic processing of the available textual information and on the definition of relation similarity, as well as, the need to exploit structural information in order to move from discovering semantically valid matches to effectively handling class specializations and generalizations.

It then integrates the ontologies by matching their instances using simple NLP techniques, and also by matching their concepts using the state-of-the-art Biomedical Ontology Alignment Tool (BOAT). SMOKR performs inconsistency detection to remove conflicting axioms in order to create a consistent ontology for querying. We evaluate the performance of the system by testing it with a set of semantic queries, and the results are compared to a keyword-based search engine, Lucene, and a hybrid system, SSOKR Luc, which combines a knowledge representation system using a single ontology and the keyword-based search engine, Lucene. SMOKR shows the best performance of F-Measures 0.7 and 0.87 on the GRO Corpus and the GENIA Corpus, respectively, compared to that of SSOKR Luc at 0.62 and 0.33, and that of Lucene at 0.36 and 0.12.

15621;"The impact of conceptualization on text classification";0;"Albitar, S. and Fournier, S. and Espinasse, B.";"Aiming at more efficient search on the Internet, it seems adequate to deploy classification techniques using semantic resources restricting this search to the users domain of interest. In this work, we try to assess the impact of integrating semantic knowledge on text classification. This integration can be realized in different ways. The one we choose in this paper is the conceptualization. We examine the impact of the different conceptualization strategies on text classification using three traditional text classification methods: Rocchio, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB). We restrain our experimentation to the biomedical domain so conceptualization is applied on OHSUMED corpus, mapping terms in text to their corresponding concepts in UMLS Metathesaurus in order to take their meaning into consideration during text classification. Rocchio, SVMs, and NB are tested using different conceptualization strategies in order to evaluate their effect on classification. Preliminary results demonstrate promising improvements.

The method can realize short text clustering by expanding feature keyword based on HowNet and combining K-means algorithm and density algorithm. It may add the number of text keyword with feature keyword expansion and increase text semantic features to realize short text clustering.

15632;"Concept-based approach to word-sense disambiguation";0;"Raviv, A. and Markovitch, S.";"The task of automatically determining the correct sense of a polysemous word has remained a challenge to this day. In our research, we introduce Concept-Based Disambiguation (CBD), a novel framework that utilizes recent semantic analysis techniques to represent both the context of the word and its senses in a high-dimensional space of natural concepts. The concepts are retrieved from a vast encyclopedic resource, thus enriching the disambiguation process with large amounts of domain-specific knowledge. In such concept-based spaces, more comprehensive measures can be applied in order to pick the right sense. Additionally, we introduce a novel representation scheme, denoted anchored representation, that builds a more specific text representation associated with an anchoring word. We evaluate our framework and show that the anchored representation is more suitable to the task of wordsense disambiguation (WSD). Additionally, we show that our system is superior to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on domain-specific corpora, and competitive with recent methods when evaluated on a general corpus.

This method allows users to browse and query texts in databases in a simple and efficient way. To facilitate content identification, the attractive design of tag clouds has been combined with an innovative text representation structure developed by our research group. This structure stems from the semantics in text representation since it keeps terms together and does not activate them separately. This structure has also been improved by the inclusion of both term order and term weight. Our proposal thus provides a more accurate form of querying and visualization by means of tag clouds.

Compared to English, Chinese has its unique expression style, such as no spaces or other word delimiters. Furthermore, Chinese short text also has its own properties. Thus we are inspired to explore effective features for sentiment classification of Chinese short text. In this paper, we propose to study userrelated sentiment classification of Chinese microblogs in terms of the statistical and semantic characteristics, and deisgn the corresponding features: ratio of positive words and negative words (PNR), position feature (POS ), collocation of verbs (COL), auxiliary words (AU). Then we employ an SVM-based method to classify the sentiment. Experiments show that the features we design is effective in recognizing the sentiment of messages in microblogs.

Besides, domain knowledge is evolving and consequently, ontologies should be automatically built and extended. Thus, introducing modularity paradigm in ontology engineering is now important to tackle scalability problems. In this paper, we address the problem of representing modular ontologies at an abstract level that can improve the traditional information system with higher efficiency, in the context of previous work aiming at integrating ontology learning in traditional Information Retrieval systems on the web. The contribution consists in organizing ontology elements into semantic three-layered ontology warehouse (topic classification, domain knowledge representation, and module representation).

The returned list of hits is often too long for the user to review every hit if he/she does not know exactly what he/she wants and/or lacks time. Our focus is on biomedical literature search - a healthcare provider needs to find important articles while a patient is waiting for the providers diagnosis or treatment decision. In this paper, we developed a fuzzy logic-based ranking approach for biomedical literature search using relevance feedback with the help of Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). UMLS is a biomedical term database that classifies and defines the biomedical language. Relevance feedback refers to an interactive process that helps to improve the retrieval efficiency via user feedback. UMLS provides meaning and semantic type methods that can be used for search result ranking, but they sometimes do not rank the search result accurately. To preliminarily evaluate our proposed approach, we created a document set containing 10 biomedical papers and 20 synthesized documents from them. We designed experiments to: 1) compare the performance of fuzzy ranking method with UMLS meaning and semantic type methods, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of using relevance feedback in the search process. Our experiments showed that 1) the fuzzy ranking approach improved the average ranking order accuracy by 3.35% and 29.55% as compared with UMLS meaning and semantic type methods respectively, and 2) better ranking result using relevance feedback in the search process.

The proposed methodology is based on a semantic analysis of textual information in reports from soldiers (war logs). Latent semantic indexing (LSI) with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as technique from multivariate analysis and linear algebra is used to extract hidden semantic textual patterns from the reports. NMF factorizes the term-by-war log matrix - that consists of weighted term frequencies - into two non-negative matrices. This enables natural parts-based representation of the report information and it leads to an easy evaluation by human experts because human brain also uses parts-based representation. For an improved research and technology planning, the identified technical problems are a valuable source of information.

15650;"Algorithms for the verification of the semantic relation between a compound and a given lexeme";0;"Kellner, G. and GrÃ¼nauer, J.";"Text mining on a lexical basis is quite well developed for the English language. In compounding languages, however, lexicalized words are often a combination of two or more semantic units. New words can be built easily by concatenating existing ones, without putting any white spaces in between. That poses a problem to existing search algorithms: Such compounds could be of high interest for a search request, but how can be examined whether a compound comprises a given lexeme? A string match can be considered as an indication, but does not prove semantic relation. The same problem is faced when using lexicon based approaches where signal words are defined as lexemes only and need to be identified in all forms of appearance, and hence also as component of a compound. This paper explores the characteristics of compounds and their constituent elements for German, and compares seven algorithms with regard to runtime and error rates. The results of this study are relevant to query analysis and term weighting approaches in information retrieval system design.

15651;"Semantic mining on customer survey";0;"Yu, Y.a  and Dang, J.b ";"Business intelligence aims to support better business decision making. Customer survey is priceless asset for intelligent business decision-making. However, business analysts usually have to read hundreds of textual comments and tabular data in survey to manually dig out the necessary information to feed business intelligence models and tools. This paper introduces a business intelligence system to solve this problem by extensively utilizing Semantic Web technologies. Ontology based knowledge extraction is the key to extract interesting terms and understand the logic concept of them. All knowledge extracted forms a semantic knowledge base. Flexible user queries and intelligent analysis can be easily issued to the system over the semantic data store through standard protocol. Besides resolving problems in theory, we designed a flexible, intuitive user interaction interface to explain and present the analysis result for business analysts. Through the real usage of this system, it is validated that our system gives good solution for semantic mining on customer survey for business intelligence.

15653;"Finding a needle in a haystack of reviews: Cold start context-based hotel recommender system";0;"Levi, A.a  and Mokryn, O.a  and Diot, C.b  and Taft, N.b ";"Online hotel searching is a daunting task due to the wealth of online information. Reviews written by other travelers replace the wordof- mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. In this work we design a cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. Our algorithm imitates a user that favors reviews written with the same trip intent and from people of similar background (nationality) and with similar preferences for hotel aspects, which are our defined context groups. Our approach combines numerous elements, including unsupervised clustering to build a vocabulary for hotel aspects, semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features, and the profiling of intent and nationality groups. We implemented our system which was used by the public to conduct 150 trip planning experiments. We compare our solution to the top suggestions of the mentioned web services and show that users were, on average, 20% more satisfied with our hotel recommendations. We outperform these web services even more in cities where hotel prices are high. Copyright Â© 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

15662;"Unsupervised similarity learning from textual data";0;"Janusz, A.a  b  and ÅšlÈ©zak, D.a  c  and Nguyen, H.S.a ";"This paper presents a research on the construction of a new unsupervised model for learning a semantic similarity measure from text corpora. Two main components of the model are a semantic interpreter of texts and a similarity function whose properties are derived from data. The first one associates particular documents with concepts defined in a knowledge base corresponding to the topics covered by the corpus. It shifts the representation of a meaning of the texts from words that can be ambiguous to concepts with predefined semantics. With this new representation, the similarity function is derived from data using a modification of the dynamic rule-based similarity model, which is adjusted to the unsupervised case. The adjustment is based on a novel notion of an information bireduct having its origin in the theory of rough sets. This extension of classical information reducts is used in order to find diverse sets of reference documents described by diverse sets of reference concepts that determine different aspects of the similarity. The paper explains a general idea of the approach and also gives some implementation guidelines.

15663;"Improving cross-document knowledge discovery using explicit semantic analysis";0;"Yan, P. and Jin, W.";"Cross-document knowledge discovery is dedicated to exploring meaningful (but maybe unapparent) information from a large volume of textual data. The sparsity and high dimensionality of text data present great challenges for representing the semantics of natural language. Our previously introduced Concept Chain Queries (CCQ) was specifically designed to discover semantic relationships between two concepts across documents where relationships found reveal semantic paths linking two concepts across multiple text units. However, answering such queries only employed the Bag of Words (BOW) representation in our previous solution, and therefore terms not appearing in the text literally are not taken into consideration. Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is a novel method proposed to represent the meaning of texts in a higher dimensional space of concepts which are derived from large-scale human built repositories such as Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose to integrate the ESA technique into our query processing, which is capable of using vast knowledge from Wikipedia to complement existing information from text corpus and alleviate the limitations resulted from the BOW representation. The experiments demonstrate the search quality has been greatly improved when incorporating ESA into answering CCQ, compared with using a BOW-based approach.

15669;"Learning the ""whys"": Discovering design rationale using text mining - An algorithm perspective";0;"Liang, Y.a  and Liu, Y.b  and Kwong, C.K.a  and Lee, W.B.a ";"Collecting design rationale (DR) and making it available in a well-organized manner will better support product design, innovation and decision-making. Many DR systems have been developed to capture DR since the 1970s. However, the DR capture process is heavily human involved. In addition, with the increasing amount of DR available in archived design documents, it has become an acute problem to research a new computational approach that is able to capture DR from free textual contents effectively. In our previous study, we have proposed an ISAL (issue, solution and artifact layer) model for DR representation. In this paper, we focus on algorithm design to discover DR from design documents according to the ISAL modeling. For the issue layer of the ISAL model, we define a semantic sentence graph to model sentence relationships through language patterns. Based on this graph, we improve the manifold-ranking algorithm to extract issue-bearing sentences. To discover solution-reason bearing sentences for the solution layer, we propose building up two sentence graphs based on candidate solution-bearing sentences and reason-bearing sentences respectively, and propagating information between them. For artifact information extraction, we propose two term relations, i.e. positional term relation and mutual term relation. Using these relations, we extend our document profile model to score the candidate terms. The performance and scalability of the algorithms proposed are tested using patents as research data joined with an example of prior art search to illustrate its application prospects.

15673;"Group matrix factorization for scalable topic modeling";0;"Wang, Q.a  and Cao, Z.b  and Xu, J.c  and Li, H.c ";"Topic modeling can reveal the latent structure of text data and is useful for knowledge discovery, search relevance ranking, document classification, and so on. One of the major challenges in topic modeling is to deal with large datasets and large numbers of topics in real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate techniques for scaling up the non-probabilistic topic modeling approaches such as RLSI and NMF. We propose a general topic modeling method, referred to as Group Matrix Factorization (GMF), to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the non-probabilistic approaches. GMF assumes that the text documents have already been categorized into multiple semantic classes, and there exist class-specific topics for each of the classes as well as shared topics across all classes. Topic modeling is then formalized as a problem of minimizing a general objective function with regularizations and/or constraints on the class-specific topics and shared topics. In this way, the learning of class-specific topics can be conducted in parallel, and thus the scalability and efficiency can be greatly improved. We apply GMF to RLSI and NMF, obtaining Group RLSI (GRLSI) and Group NMF (GNMF) respectively. Experiments on a Wikipedia dataset and a real-world web dataset, each containing about 3 million documents, show that GRLSI and GNMF can greatly improve RLSI and NMF in terms of scalability and efficiency. The topics discovered by GRLSI and GNMF are coherent and have good readability. Further experiments on a search relevance dataset, containing 30,000 labeled queries, show that the use of topics learned by GRLSI and GNMF can significantly improve search relevance.

15674;"Detecting causality from online psychiatric texts using inter-sentential language patterns";0;"Wu, J.-L. and Yu, L.-C. and Chang, P.-C.";"Background: Online psychiatric texts are natural language texts expressing depressive problems, published by Internet users via community-based web services such as web forums, message boards and blogs. Understanding the cause-effect relations embedded in these psychiatric texts can provide insight into the authors problems, thus increasing the effectiveness of online psychiatric services. Methods: Previous studies have proposed the use of word pairs extracted from a set of sentence pairs to identify cause-effect relations between sentences. A word pair is made up of two words, with one coming from the cause text span and the other from the effect text span. Analysis of the relationship between these words can be used to capture individual word associations between cause and effect sentences. For instance, (broke up, life) and (boyfriend, meaningless) are two word pairs extracted from the sentence pair: I broke up with my boyfriend. Life is now meaningless to me. The major limitation of word pairs is that individual words in sentences usually cannot reflect the exact meaning of the cause and effect events, and thus may produce semantically incomplete word pairs, as the previous examples show. Therefore, this study proposes the use of inter-sentential language patterns such as â‰«broke up, boyfriend<, >life, meaninglessâ‰ª to detect causality between sentences. The inter-sentential language patterns can capture associations among multiple words within and between sentences, thus can provide more precise information than word pairs. To acquire inter-sentential language patterns, we develop a text mining framework by extending the classical association rule mining algorithm such that it can discover frequently co-occurring patterns across the sentence boundary. Results: Performance was evaluated on a corpus of texts collected from PsychPark (http://www.psychpark. org), a virtual psychiatric clinic maintained by a group of volunteer professionals from the Taiwan Association of Mental Health Informatics. Experimental results show that the use of inter-sentential language patterns outperformed the use of word pairs proposed in previous studies. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the acquisition of inter-sentential language patterns for causality detection from online psychiatric texts. Such semantically more complete and precise features can improve causality detection performance.

15675;"An algorithm for fuzzy-based sentence-level document clustering for micro-level contradiction analysis";0;"Mehta, R.V.K. and Sankarasubramaniam, B. and Rajalakshmi, S.";"Contradiction Analysis is one of the popular text-mining operations in which a document whose content is contradictory to the theme of a set of documents is identified. It is a means to identifying Outlier documents that do not confirm to the overall sense conveyed by other documents. Most of the existing techniques perform document-level comparisons, ignoring the sentence-level semantics, often leading to loss of vital information. Applications in domains like Defence and Healthcare require high levels of accuracy and identification of micro-level contradictions are vital.

15676;"A framework for robust discovery of entity synonyms";0;"Chakrabarti, K.a  and Chaudhuri, S.a  and Cheng, T.a  and Xin, D.a  b ";"Entity synonyms are critical for many applications like information retrieval and named entity recognition in documents. The current trend is to automatically discover entity synonyms using statistical techniques on web data. Prior techniques suffer from several limitations like click log sparsity and inability to distinguish between entities of different concept classes. In this paper, we propose a general framework for robustly discovering entity synonym with two novel similarity functions that overcome the limitations of prior techniques. We develop efficient and scalable techniques leveraging the MapReduce framework to discover synonyms at large scale. To handle long entity names with extraneous tokens, we propose techniques to effectively map long entity names to short queries in query log. Our experiments on real data from different entity domains demonstrate the superior quality of our synonyms as well as the efficiency of our algorithms. The entity synonyms produced by our system is in production in Bing Shopping and Video search, with experiments showing the significance it brings in improving search experience.

15677;"Large-scale learning of word relatedness with constraints";0;"Halawi, G.a  and Dror, G.b  and Gabrilovich, E.c  and Koren, Y.b ";"Prior work on computing semantic relatedness of words focused on representing their meaning in isolation, effectively disregarding inter-word affinities. We propose a large-scale data mining approach to learning word-word relatedness, where known pairs of related words impose constraints on the learning process. We learn for each word a low-dimensional representation, which strives to maximize the likelihood of a word given the contexts in which it appears. Our method, called CLEAR, is shown to significantly outperform previously published approaches. The proposed method is based on first principles, and is generic enough to exploit diverse types of text corpora, while having the flexibility to impose constraints on the derived word similarities. We also make publicly available a new labeled dataset for evaluating word relatedness algorithms, which we believe to be the largest such dataset to date.

Intensive research has been conducted in this area during the past decade. However, most researchers failed to notice that ignoring the semantic importance of certain feature terms might also contribute to low classification accuracy. In this paper we present a new method to tackle the problem by building a strong feature thesaurus (SFT) based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and information gain (IG) models. By giving larger weights to feature terms in SFT, the classification accuracy can be improved. Specifically, our method appeared to be more effective with more detailed classification.

Computational methods and formal representations of knowledge usually neglect this kind of individual variation. We have developed a novel method, Grounded Intersubjective Concept Analysis (GICA), for the analysis and visualization of individual differences in language use and conceptualization. The GICA method first employs a conceptual survey or a text mining step to elicit from varied groups of individuals the particular ways in which terms and associated concepts are used among the individuals. The subsequent analysis and visualization reveals potential underlying groupings of subjects, objects and contexts. One way of viewing the GICA method is to compare it with the traditional word space models. In the word space models, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), statistical analysis of word-context matrices reveals latent information. A common approach is to analyze term-document matrices in the analysis. The GICA method extends the basic idea of the traditional term-document matrix analysis to include a third dimension of different individuals. This leads to a formation of a third-order tensor of size subjects Ã— objects Ã— contexts. Through flattening into a matrix, these subject-object-context (SOC) tensors can again be analyzed using various computational methods including principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), independent component analysis (ICA) or any existing or future method suitable for analyzing high-dimensional data sets. In order to demonstrate the use of the GICA method, we present the results of two case studies. In the first case, GICA of health-related concepts is conducted. In the second one, the State of the Union addresses by US presidents are analyzed. In these case studies, we apply multidimensional scaling (MDS), the self-organizing map (SOM) and Neighborhood Retrieval Visualizer (NeRV) as specific data analysis methods within the overall GICA method. The GICA method can be used, for instance, to support education of heterogeneous audiences, public planning processes and participatory design, conflict resolution, environmental problem solving, interprofessional and interdisciplinary communication, product development processes, mergers of organizations, and building enhanced knowledge representations in semantic web.

15696;"Proper noun semantic clustering using bag-of-vectors";0;"Ebadat, A.R.a  and Claveau, V.b  and SÃ©billot, P.a ";"In this paper, we propose a model for semantic clustering of entities extracted from a text, and we apply it to a Proper Noun classification task. This model is based on a new method to compute the similarity between the entities. Indeed, the classical way of calculating similarity is to build a feature vector or Bag-of-Features for each entity and then use classical similarity functions like Cosine. In practice, the features are contextual, such as words around the different occurrences of each entity. Here, we propose to use an alternative representation for entities, called Bag-of-Vectors, or Bag-of-Bags-of-Features. In this new model, each entity is not defined as a unique vector but as a set of vectors, in which each vector is built based on the contextual features of one occurrence of the entity. In order to use Bag-of-Vectors for clustering, we introduce new versions of classical similarity functions such as Cosine and Scalar Products. Experimentally, we show that the Bag-of-Vectors representation always improve the clustering results compared to classical Bag-of-Features representations.

15698;"A pattern discovery model for effective text mining";0;"Pipanmaekaporn, L. and Li, Y.";"The quality of extracted features is the key issue to text mining due to the large number of terms, phrases, and noise.

However, the quality of the extracted terms in text documents may be not high because of lot of noise in text. For many years, some researchers make use of various phrases that have more semantics than single words to improve the relevance, but many experiments do not support the effective use of phrases since they have low frequency of occurrence, and include many redundant and noise phrases. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern discovery approach for text mining. This approach first discovers closed sequential patterns in text documents for identifying the most informative contents of the documents and then utilise the identified contents to extract useful features for text mining. We develop a novel fusion method based on Dempster-Shafers evidential reasoning which allows to combine the pieces of document to discover the knowledge (features).

15700;"An intelligent system approach for integrating anatomical ontologies";0;"Petrov, P.a  and Krachunov, M.a  and Todorovska, E.b  and Vassilev, D.a ";"Recent years have seen a vast amount of data generated by various biological and biomedical experiments. The storage, management and analysis of this data, is done by means of the modern bioinformatics applications and tools. One of the bioinformatics instruments used for solving these tasks, are ontologies and the apparatus they provide. Ontology as a modeling tool is a specification of a conceptualization meaning that an ontology is a formal description of the concepts and relationships that can exist for a given software system or software agent (8, 10). Anatomical (phenotypic) ontologies of various species nowadays typically contain from few thousands to few tens of thousands of terms and relations (which is a very small number compared to the count of objects and the amount of data produced by biological experiments at the molecular level, for example) but usually the semantics employed in them is enormous in scale. The major problem when using such ontologies is that they lack intelligent tools for cross-species literature searches (text mining) as well as tools aiding the design of new biological and biomedical experiments with other (not yet tested) species/organisms, based on available information about experiments already performed on certain model species/organisms. This is where the process of merging anatomical ontologies comes into use. Using specific models and algorithms for merging of such ontologies is a matter of choice. In this work a novel approach for solving this task, based on two directed acyclic graph (DAG) models and three original algorithmic procedures is presented. Based on them, an intelligent software system for merging two (and possibly more) input/source anatomical ontologies into one output/target super-ontology was designed and implemented. This system was named AnatOM (an abbreviation from ""Anatomical Ontologies Merger""). In this work a short overview of ontologies is provided describing what ontologies are and why they are widely used as a tool in bioinformatics. The problem of merging anatomical ontologies of two or more different organisms is introduced and some effort has been put into explaining why it is important. A general outline is presented of the models and the method that have been developed for solving the ontologies merging problem. A high-level overview of the AnatOM program implemented by the authors as part of this work is also provided.

This paper reports a high-precision, domain-independent approach for automatic emotion sensing for ""events"" embedded in sentences. The proposed approach is based on the common action distribution between the subject and object of an event. We have incorporated semantic labeling and web-based text mining techniques, together with a number of reference entity pairs and hand-crafted emotion generation rules to realize an event emotion detection system. Moreover, a hybrid emotion detection engine is presented by incorporating a set of predefined emotion keywords and the proposed event-level emotion detection engine. The evaluation outcome reveals a rather satisfactory result with about 73% accuracy for detecting the Happy, Sad, Fear, Angry, Surprise, Disgust, and Neutral.

In this paper, focusing on the Chinese interactive text, we explored a novel topic detection method, named SDD-PLSA, which integrates Semantic Dependency Distance (SDD) and PLSA. It not only has the advantages of PLSA, which is an efficient, effective method and is widely used in text mining, but also considers the semantic and syntax information. Thus, the problem of lacking semantic information in PLSA can be avoided. SDD-PLSA has two main steps. The first is using SDD to classify the sentences that have a high similarity in semantics into several groups according to semantic feature extraction of the interactive text. Then, a PLSA classifier is used upon the result of the first step. The experiments show that the accuracy of detection on love topic has been improved to 64.8% when using SDD-PLSA, better than 55.4% when using PLSA.

Previous studies using TRIZ evolution trends have determined patents with high evolutionary potential as high value technology in the future without considering relative importance of each TRIZ trend in a specific technology domain. Thus, previous approaches have limitations in that the importance of TRIZ evolution trends can be different according to the technology domain and current stage of the technology cycle of the technology domain. To overcome such limitations, we propose a method which can consider the priority of importance of TRIZ evolution trends and the technology cycle. To this end, we adopted an SAO-based text mining approach and semantic similarity measurement method.

15721;"Mining feature-opinion pairs and their reliability scores from web opinion sources";0;"Kamal, A.a  and Abulaish, M.b  and Anwar, T.b ";"Due to proliferation of Web 2.0, there is an exponential growth in user generated contents in the form of customer reviews on the Web, containing precious information useful for both customers and manufacturers. However, most of the contents are stored in either unstructured or semi-structured format due to which distillation of knowledge from this huge repository is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a text mining approach to mine product features, opinions and their reliability scores from Web opinion sources. A rule-based system is implemented, which applies linguistic and semantic analysis of texts to mine feature-opinion pairs that have sentence-level co-occurrence in review documents. The extracted feature-opinion pairs and source documents are modeled using a bipartite graph structure. Considering feature-opinion pairs as hubs and source documents as authorities, Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm is applied to generate reliability score for each feature-opinion pair with respect to the underlying corpus. The efficacy of the proposed system is established through experimentation over customer reviews on different models of electronic products.

The area of text mining aims at discovering knowledge from data of this type. Most work in this area uses the model known as bag of words to represent the texts. This form of representation, although effective, minimizes the quality of knowledge discovered because it is not able to capture essential characteristics of this type of data such as semantics and context. The paradigm of granular computing has been shown effective in the treatment of complex problems of information processing and can produce significant results in large-scale environments such as the Web. This paper explores the granulation process of words with a view to its application in the subsequent improvement in text representation.

To address it, patterns of co-occurring words or characters are typically extracted from the textual content of Web documents. However, not all documents are of the same quality; for example, the curated content of news articles usually entails lower levels of noise than the user-generated content of the blog posts and the other Social Media. In this paper, we provide some insight and a preliminary study on a tripartite categorization of Web documents, based on inherent document characteristics. We claim and support that each category calls for different classification settings with respect to the representation model. We verify this claim experimentally, by showing that topic classification on these different document types offers very different results per type. In addition, we consider a novel approach that improves the performance of topic classification across all types of Web documents: namely the n-gram graphs. This model goes beyond the established bag-of-words one, representing each document as a graph. Individual graphs can be combined into a class graph and graph similarities are then employed to position and classify documents into the vector space. Accuracy is increased due to the contextual information that is encapsulated in the edges of the n-gram graphs; efficiency, on the other hand, is boosted by reducing the feature space to a limited set of dimensions that depend on the number of classes, rather than the size of the vocabulary. Our experimental study over three large-scale, real-world data sets validates the higher performance of n-gram graphs in all three domains of Web documents.

Linked data is a term used for data resources that are created using semantic web standards such as DBpedia. There are a number of online tools that try to identify named entities in text and link them to linked data resources. Although one can use these tools via their APIs and web interfaces, they use different data resources and different techniques to identify named entities and not all of them reveal this information. One of the major tasks in NER is disambiguation that is identifying the right entity among a number of entities with the same names; for example ""apple"" standing for both ""Apple, Inc."" the company and the fruit. We developed a similar tool called NERSO, short for Named Entity Recognition Using Semantic Open Data, to automatically extract named entities, disambiguating and linking them to DBpedia entities. Our disambiguation method is based on constructing a graph of linked data entities and scoring them using a graph-based centrality algorithm.

Then we propose two text mining approaches like K-means clustering and Support Vector Machine with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-SVM) classification algorithms that can be used to group into two forum clusters forming hotspot forums and non-hotspot forums within each time window. The text datasets that we use in our experimental research are collected from forums.digitalpoint.com and after data cleaning they are formatted to 37 different forums and 1616 threads. The experiment helps to identify that K-means and PSO-SVM together achieve highly consistent results.

15741;"Ontology-based semantic similarity: A new feature-based approach";0;"SÃ¡nchez, D. and Batet, M. and Isern, D. and Valls, A.";"Estimation of the semantic likeness between words is of great importance in many applications dealing with textual data such as natural language processing, knowledge acquisition and information retrieval. Semantic similarity measures exploit knowledge sources as the base to perform the estimations. In recent years, ontologies have grown in interest thanks to global initiatives such as the Semantic Web, offering an structured knowledge representation. Thanks to the possibilities that ontologies enable regarding semantic interpretation of terms many ontology-based similarity measures have been developed. According to the principle in which those measures base the similarity assessment and the way in which ontologies are exploited or complemented with other sources several families of measures can be identified. In this paper, we survey and classify most of the ontology-based approaches developed in order to evaluate their advantages and limitations and compare their expected performance both from theoretical and practical points of view. We also present a new ontology-based measure relying on the exploitation of taxonomical features. The evaluation and comparison of our approachs results against those reported by related works under a common framework suggest that our measure provides a high accuracy without some of the limitations observed in other works.

15747;"Semantic analysis of functional and non-functional requirements in software requirements specifications";0;"Rashwan, A.";"Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) documents are important artifacts in the software industry. A SRS contains all the requirements specifications for a software system, either as functional requirements (FR) or non-functional requirements (NFR). FRs are the features of the system-to-be, whereas NFRs define its quality attributes. NFRs impact the system as a whole and interact both with each other and with the functional requirements. SRS documents are typically written in informal natural language [1], which impedes their automated analysis. The goal of this work is to support software engineers with semantic analysis methods that can automatically extract and analyze requirements written in natural language texts, in order to (i) make SRS documents machine-processable by transforming them into an ontological representation; (ii) apply quality assurance (QA) methods on the extracted requirements, in order to detect defects, like ambiguities or omissions; and (iii) attempt to build traceability links between NFRs and the FRs impacted by them, in order to aid effort estimation models.

15749;"Study of ontology or thesaurus based document clustering and information retrieval";0;"Bharathi, G. and Venkatesan, D.";"Document clustering generates clusters from the whole document collection automatically and is used in many fields, including data mining and information retrieval. Clustering text data faces a number of new challenges. Among others, the volume of text data, dimensionality, sparsity and complex semantics are the most important ones. These characteristics of text data require clustering techniques to be scalable to large and high dimensional data, and able to handle sparsity and semantics. In the traditional vector space model, the unique words occurring in the document set are used as the features. But because of the synonym problem and the polysemous problem, such a bag of original words cannot represent the content of a document precisely. Most of the existing text clustering methods use clustering techniques which depend only on term strength and document frequency where single terms are used as features for representing the documents and they are treated independently which can be easily applied to non-ontological clustering. To overcome the above issues, this paper makes a survey of recent research done on ontology or thesaurus based document clustering. Â© 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

15750;"Text document clustering using global term context vectors";0;"Kalogeratos, A. and Likas, A.";"Despite the advantages of the traditional vector space model (VSM) representation, there are known deficiencies concerning the term independence assumption. The high dimensionality and sparsity of the text feature space and phenomena such as polysemy and synonymy can only be handled if a way is provided to measure term similarity. Many approaches have been proposed that map document vectors onto a new feature space where learning algorithms can achieve better solutions. This paper presents the global term context vector-VSM (GTCV-VSM) method for text document representation. It is an extension to VSM that: (i) it captures local contextual information for each term occurrence in the term sequences of documents; (ii) the local contexts for the occurrences of a term are combined to define the global context of that term; (iii) using the global context of all terms a proper semantic matrix is constructed; (iv) this matrix is further used to linearly map traditional VSM (Bag of Words-BOW) document vectors onto a semantically smoothed feature space where problems such as text document clustering can be solved more efficiently. We present an experimental study demonstrating the improvement of clustering results when the proposed GTCV-VSM representation is used compared with traditional VSM-based approaches.

15753;"Clustering and understanding documents via discrimination information maximization";0;"Hassan, M.T. and Karim, A.";"Text document clustering is a popular task for understanding and summarizing large document collections. Besides the need for efficiency, document clustering methods should produce clusters that are readily understandable as collections of documents relating to particular contexts or topics. Existing clustering methods often ignore term-document semantics while relying upon geometric similarity measures. In this paper, we present an efficient iterative partitional clustering method, CDIM, that maximizes the sum of discrimination information provided by documents. The discrimination information of a document is computed from the discrimination information provided by the terms in it, and term discrimination information is estimated from the currently labeled document collection. A key advantage of CDIM is that its clusters are describable by their highly discriminating terms - terms with high semantic relatedness to their clusters contexts. We evaluate CDIM both qualitatively and quantitatively on ten text data sets. In clustering quality evaluation, we find that CDIM produces high-quality clusters superior to those generated by the best methods. We also demonstrate the understandability provided by CDIM, suggesting its suitability for practical document clustering.

15754;"Deviation detection in text using conceptual graph interchange format and error tolerance dissimilarity function";0;"Kamaruddin, S.S.a  b  and Hamdan, A.R.b  and Bakar, A.A.b  and Mat Nor, F.c ";"The rapid increase in the amount of textual data has brought forward a growing research interest towards mining text to detect deviations. Specialized methods for specific domains have emerged to satisfy various needs in discovering rare patterns in text. This paper focuses on a graph-based approach for text representation and presents a novel error tolerance dissimilarity algorithm for deviation detection. We resolve two non-trivial problems, i.e. semantic representation of text and the complexity of graph matching. We employ conceptual graphs interchange format (CGIF) - a knowledge representation formalism to capture the structure and semantics of sentences. We propose a novel error tolerance dissimilarity algorithm to detect deviations in the CGIFs. We evaluate our method in the context of analyzing real world financial statements for identifying deviating performance indicators. We show that our method performs better when compared with two related text based graph similarity measuring methods. Our proposed method has managed to identify deviating sentences and it strongly correlates with expert judgments. Furthermore, it offers error tolerance matching of CGIFs and retains a linear complexity with the increasing number of CGIFs. Â© 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Ads classification is one of main tasks in contextual advertising, and it is used to retrieve semantically relevant ads with respect to the content of web pages. However, it is difficult for traditional text classification methods to achieve satisfactory performance in ads classification due to scarce term features in ads. In this paper, we propose a novel ads classification method that handles the lack of term features for classifying ads with short text. The proposed method utilizes a vocabulary expansion technique using semantic associations among terms learned from large-scale search query logs.

The system integrates several recent achievements in the area of handwriting recognition, natural language processing, information retrieval, and human computer interaction. It uses a knowledge base described by the resource description framework (RDF). Our generic approach first generates a lexicon as background information for the handwritten text recognition. After recognizing a handwritten query, several output hypotheses are sent to a natural language processing system in order to generate a structured query (SPARQL query). Subsequently, the query is applied to the given knowledge base and a result graph visualizes the retrieved information. At all stages, the user can easily adjust the intermediate results if there is any undesired outcome. The system is implemented as a web-service and therefore works for handwritten input on digital paper as well as on input on Pen-enabled interactive surfaces. Furthermore, we build on the generic RDF-representation of semantic knowledge which is also used by the linked open data (LOD) initiative. As such, our system works well in various scenarios.

15760;"Studying of semantic similarity methods in ontology";0;"Reshadat, V.a  and Feizi-Derakhshi, M.-R.b ";"Humans are able to easily judge if a pair of concepts are related in some way. Understanding of how humans are able to perform this task is not easy. Semantic similarity denotes computing the similarity between concepts, having the same meaning or related information, which are not necessarily lexically similar. Semantic similarity between concepts plays an important role in Semantic Web, knowledge sharing, Web mining, semantic sense understanding and text summarization. This also is an important problem in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval Researches. These techniques are becoming important components of most of the Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) and other intelligent knowledge based systems. Therefore it has received considerable attention in the literature. Ontology has a good hierarchical structure of concepts. In the ontology, semantic information can be realized through the semantic relationship of concepts. Ontology-based semantic similarity techniques can estimate the semantic similarity between two hierarchically expressed concepts in a given ontology or taxonomy. Semantic similarity is usually computed by mapping concepts to ontology and by examining their relationships in it. The most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet and MeSH. Several algorithmic approaches for computing semantic similarity have been proposed. This paper discusses the various approaches used for identifying semantically similar concepts in ontology.

15761;"Extracting semantically enriched events from biomedical literature";0;"Miwa, M.a  b  and Thompson, P.a  b  and McNaught, J.a  b  and Kell, D.B.c  and Ananiadou, S.a  b ";"Background: Research into event-based text mining from the biomedical literature has been growing in popularity to facilitate the development of advanced biomedical text mining systems. Such technology permits advanced search, which goes beyond document or sentence-based retrieval. However, existing event-based systems typically ignore additional information within the textual context of events that can determine, amongst other things, whether an event represents a fact, hypothesis, experimental result or analysis of results, whether it describes new or previously reported knowledge, and whether it is speculated or negated. We refer to such contextual information as meta-knowledge. The automatic recognition of such information can permit the training of systems allowing finer-grained searching of events according to the meta-knowledge that is associated with them.Results: Based on a corpus of 1,000 MEDLINE abstracts, fully manually annotated with both events and associated meta-knowledge, we have constructed a machine learning-based system that automatically assigns meta-knowledge information to events. This system has been integrated into EventMine, a state-of-the-art event extraction system, in order to create a more advanced system (EventMine-MK) that not only extracts events from text automatically, but also assigns five different types of meta-knowledge to these events. The meta-knowledge assignment module of EventMine-MK performs with macro-averaged F-scores in the range of 57-87% on the BioNLP09 Shared Task corpus. EventMine-MK has been evaluated on the BioNLP09 Shared Task subtask of detecting negated and speculated events. Our results show that EventMine-MK can outperform other state-of-the-art systems that participated in this task.Conclusions: We have constructed the first practical system that extracts both events and associated, detailed meta-knowledge information from biomedical literature. The automatically assigned meta-knowledge information can be used to refine search systems, in order to provide an extra search layer beyond entities and assertions, dealing with phenomena such as rhetorical intent, speculations, contradictions and negations. This finer grained search functionality can assist in several important tasks, e.g., database curation (by locating new experimental knowledge) and pathway enrichment (by providing information for inference). To allow easy integration into text mining systems, EventMine-MK is provided as a UIMA component that can be used in the interoperable text mining infrastructure, U-Compare.

A micro-blog public opinion corpus named MPO Corpus on the content of micro-blog information as a test data set has been constructed by our research team. In this paper, it proposes a quick emergency response model (QERM) for micro-blog public opinion crisis oriented to Mobile Internet services. Firstly, it describes the micro-blog cases and emergency response plan library using web ontology language (OWL), which makes the transitive logical reason capacity among micro-blog subjects, microblog cases and emergency plans. Secondly, it proposes an algorithm to calculate the sentiment intensity of micro-blogs from three levels on words, sentences and documents based on HowNet Knowledge-base respectively. Thirdly, we continue to study on how to update cases under the subjects and quick response processes for micro-blog case base.

15763;"Enriching domain-specific language models using domain independent WWW n-gram corpus";0;"Chang, H.";"This paper describes the new techniques developed to extract and compute the domain-specific knowledge implicitly embedded in a highly structural ontology-based information system for TV Electronic Programming Guide (EPG). The domain knowledge represented by a set of mutually related n-gram data sets is then enriched by exploring the explicit structural dependencies and implicit semantic association between the data entities in the domain and the domain-independent texts from the Google 1 trillion 5-grams corpus created from general WWW documents. The knowledge-based enrichment process creates the language models required for a natural language based EPG search system that outperform the baseline model created only from the original EPG data source by a significant margin measured by an absolute improvement of 14.1% on the model coverage (recall accuracy) using large-scale test data collected from a real-world EPG search application.

The prototype aims to provide a multilingual natural language interface for querying the content of patent documents. The developed system is focused on the biomedical and pharmaceutical domain and includes the translation of the patent claims and abstracts into English, French and German. Aiming at the best retrieval results of the patent information and text content, patent documents are preprocessed and semantically annotated. Then, the annotations are stored and indexed in an OWLIM semantic repository, which contains a patent specific ontology and others from different domains. The prototype, accessible online at http://molto-patents.ontotext.com, presents a multilingual natural language interface to query the retrieval system. In MOLTO, the multilingualism of the queries is addressed by means of the GF Tool, which provides an easy way to build and maintain controlled language grammars for interlingual translation in limited domains. The abstract representation obtained from the GF is used to retrieve both the matched RDF instances and the list of patents semantically related to the users search criteria. The online interface allows to browse the retrieved patents and shows on the text the semantic annotations that explain the reason why any particular patent has matched the users criteria.

15771;"Automatic text classification of sports blog data";0;"Dalal, M.K.a  and Zaveri, M.A.b ";"Automatic Text Classification is a semi-supervised machine learning task that automatically assigns a given text document to a set of pre-defined categories based on the features extracted from its textual content. This paper attempts to automatically classify the textual entries made by bloggers on various sports blogs, to the appropriate category of sport by following steps like pre-processing, feature extraction and naÃ¯ve Bayesian classification. Empirical evaluation of this technique has resulted in a classification accuracy of approximately 87% over the test set. In addition to classifying the textual entries of sports blogs, it is proposed that the extracted features themselves be further classified under more meaningful heads which results in generation of a semantic resource that lends greater understanding to the classification task. This semantic resource can be used for data mining requirements that arise in the future.

Our approach waives the common practice of expanding the feature-space with new dimensions derived either from explicit or from latent semantic analysis. As a consequence it is simple and maintains a compact intelligible representation of the output categories.

Finding a clustering method that is able to cluster short text in general is difficult. In this paper, we cluster 4 different corpora with different types of text with varying length and evaluate them against the gold standard. Based on these clustering experiments, we show how different similarity measures, clustering algorithms, and cluster evaluation methods effect the resulting clusters. We discuss four existing corpus based similarity methods, Cosine similarity, Latent Semantic Analysis, Short text Vector Space Model, and Kullback-Leibler distance, four well known clustering methods, Complete Link, Single Link, Average Link hierarchical clustering and Spectral clustering, and three evaluation methods, clustering F-measure, adjusted Rand Index, and V. Our experiments show that corpus based similarity measures do not significantly affect the clusters and that the performance of spectral clustering is better than hierarchical clustering.

Finally, we evaluate our approach on Wikipedia in five different languages and compare the results with the WordNet taxonomy and a multilingual approach based on interwiki links of the Wikipedia.

By extracting linguistic information such as part-of-speech, semantic, co-occurrence of keywords, we construct a domain-adaptive transfer knowledge base. Relation experiments show that, the presented method improved the performance of text categorization on traditional corpus, and our results were only about 5% lower than the baseline on cross-domain classification tasks.

In this paper, a novel approach for semantic composition based on space projection techniques over lexical vector representations is proposed. In line with the principle of compositionality, the meaning of a phrase is modeled in terms of the subset of properties shared by co-occurring words. Syntactic bi-grams are thus projected in the so called Support Subspace, corresponding to such properties. State-of-the-art results are achieved in a well known phrase similarity task, used as a benchmark for this class of methods.

15802;"Exploiting wikipedia knowledge for conceptual hierarchical clustering of documents";0;"Spanakis, G. and Siolas, G. and Stafylopatis, A.";"In this paper, we propose a novel method for conceptual hierarchical clustering of documents using knowledge extracted from Wikipedia. The proposed method overcomes the classic bag-of-words models disadvantages through the exploitation of Wikipedia textual content and link structure. A robust and compact document representation is built in real-time using the Wikipedia application programmers interface, without the need to store locally any Wikipedia information. The clustering process is hierarchical and extends the idea of frequent items by using Wikipedia article titles for selecting cluster labels that are descriptive and important for the examined corpus. Experiments show that the proposed technique greatly improves over the baseline approach, both in terms of F-measure and entropy on the one hand and computational cost on the other.

15808;"Learning non-taxonomical semantic relations from domain texts";0;"Punuru, J.a  and Chen, J.b ";"Ontology of a domain mainly consists of concepts, taxonomical (hierarchical) relations and non-taxonomical relations. Automatic ontology construction requires methods for extracting both taxonomical and non-taxonomical relations. Compared to extensive works on concept extraction and taxonomical relation learning, little attention has been given on identification and labeling of non-taxonomical relations in text mining. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised technique for extracting non-taxonomical relations from domain texts. We propose the VFICF metric for measuring the importance of a verb as a representative relation label, in much the same spirit as the TFIDF measure in information retrieval. Domain-relevant concepts (nouns) are extracted using techniques developed earlier. Candidate non-taxonomical relations are generated as (SVO) triples of the form (subject, verb, object) from domain texts. A statistical method with log-likelihood ratios is used to estimate the significance of relationships between concepts and to select suitable relation labels. Texts from two domains, the Electronic Voting (EV) domain texts and the Tenders and Mergers (TNM) domain texts are used to compare our method with one of the existing approaches. Experiments showed that our method achieved better performance in both domains.

15811;"Enhancing clinical concept extraction with distributional semantics";0;"Jonnalagadda, S.a  b  and Cohen, T.c  and Wu, S.b  and Gonzalez, G.a ";"Extracting concepts (such as drugs, symptoms, and diagnoses) from clinical narratives constitutes a basic enabling technology to unlock the knowledge within and support more advanced reasoning applications such as diagnosis explanation, disease progression modeling, and intelligent analysis of the effectiveness of treatment. The recent release of annotated training sets of de-identified clinical narratives has contributed to the development and refinement of concept extraction methods. However, as the annotation process is labor-intensive, training data are necessarily limited in the concepts and concept patterns covered, which impacts the performance of supervised machine learning applications trained with these data. This paper proposes an approach to minimize this limitation by combining supervised machine learning with empirical learning of semantic relatedness from the distribution of the relevant words in additional unannotated text.The approach uses a sequential discriminative classifier (Conditional Random Fields) to extract the mentions of medical problems, treatments and tests from clinical narratives. It takes advantage of all Medline abstracts indexed as being of the publication type "" clinical trials"" to estimate the relatedness between words in the i2b2/VA training and testing corpora. In addition to the traditional features such as dictionary matching, pattern matching and part-of-speech tags, we also used as a feature words that appear in similar contexts to the word in question (that is, words that have a similar vector representation measured with the commonly used cosine metric, where vector representations are derived using methods of distributional semantics). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort exploring the use of distributional semantics, the semantics derived empirically from unannotated text often using vector space models, for a sequence classification task such as concept extraction. Therefore, we first experimented with different sliding window models and found the model with parameters that led to best performance in a preliminary sequence labeling task.The evaluation of this approach, performed against the i2b2/VA concept extraction corpus, showed that incorporating features based on the distribution of words across a large unannotated corpus significantly aids concept extraction. Compared to a supervised-only approach as a baseline, the micro-averaged F-score for exact match increased from 80.3% to 82.3% and the micro-averaged F-score based on inexact match increased from 89.7% to 91.3%. These improvements are highly significant according to the bootstrap resampling method and also considering the performance of other systems. Thus, distributional semantic features significantly improve the performance of concept extraction from clinical narratives by taking advantage of word distribution information obtained from unannotated data.

15813;"Improving information retrieval using document clusters and semantic synonym extraction";0;"Bharathi, G. and Venkatesan, D.";"Document clustering has been investigated for use in a number of different areas of text mining and information retrieval. Initially, document clustering was investigated for improving the precision or recall in information retrieval systems and as an efficient way of finding the nearest neighbors of a document. More recently, clustering has been proposed for use in browsing a collection of documents or in organizing the results returned by a search engine in response to a users query. This paper presents a new semantic synonym based correlation indexing method in which documents are clustered based on nearest neighbors from the document collection and then further refined by semantically relating the query term with the retrieved documents by making use of a thesaurus or ontology model to improve the performance of Information Retrieval System (IRS) by increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved. Results show that the proposed method achieves significant improvement than the existing methods and may generate the more relevant document in the top rank. Â© 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

15816;"Latent semantic analysis: Five methodological recommendations";0;"Evangelopoulos, N.a  and Zhang, X.b  and Prybutok, V.R.a ";"The recent influx in generation, storage, and availability of textual data presents researchers with the challenge of developing suitable methods for their analysis. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a member of a family of methodological approaches that offers an opportunity to address this gap by describing the semantic content in textual data as a set of vectors, was pioneered by researchers in psychology, information retrieval, and bibliometrics. LSA involves a matrix operation called singular value decomposition, an extension of principal component analysis. LSA generates latent semantic dimensions that are either interpreted, if the researchers primary interest lies with the understanding of the thematic structure in the textual data, or used for purposes of clustering, categorization, and predictive modeling, if the interest lies with the conversion of raw text into numerical data, as a precursor to subsequent analysis. This paper reviews five methodological issues that need to be addressed by the researcher who will embark on LSA. We examine the dilemmas, present the choices, and discuss the considerations under which good methodological decisions are made. We illustrate these issues with the help of four small studies, involving the analysis of abstracts for papers published in the European Journal of Information Systems.

15825;"Quantitative approaches to content analysis: Identifying conceptual drift across publication outlets";0;"Indulska, M.a  and Hovorka, D.S.b  and Recker, J.c ";"Unstructured text data, such as emails, blogs, contracts, academic publications, organizational documents, transcribed interviews, and even tweets, are important sources of data in Information Systems research. Various forms of qualitative analysis of the content of these data exist and have revealed important insights. Yet, to date, these analyses have been hampered by limitations of human coding of large data sets, and by bias due to human interpretation. In this paper, we compare and combine two quantitative analysis techniques to demonstrate the capabilities of computational analysis for content analysis of unstructured text. Specifically, we seek to demonstrate how two quantitative analytic methods, viz., Latent Semantic Analysis and data mining, can aid researchers in revealing core content topic areas in large (or small) data sets, and in visualizing how these concepts evolve, migrate, converge or diverge over time. We exemplify the complementary application of these techniques through an examination of a 25-year sample of abstracts from selected journals in Information Systems, Management, and Accounting disciplines. Through this work, we explore the capabilities of two computational techniques, and show how these techniques can be used to gather insights from a large corpus of unstructured text.

15826;"Phrase-level sentiment polarity classification using rule-based typed dependencies and additional complex phrases consideration";0;"Tan, L.K.-W.a  and Na, J.-C.a  and Theng, Y.-L.a  and Chang, K.b ";"The advent of Web 2.0 has led to an increase in user-generated content on the Web. This has provided an extensive collection of free-style texts with opinion expressions that could influence the decisions and actions of their readers. Providers of such content exert a certain level of influence on the receivers and this is evident from blog sites having effect on their readers purchase decisions, political view points, financial planning, and others. By detecting the opinion expressed, we can identify the sentiments on the topics discussed and the influence exerted on the readers. In this paper, we introduce an automatic approach in deriving polarity pattern rules to detect sentiment polarity at the phrase level, and in addition consider the effects of the more complex relationships found between words in sentiment polarity classification. Recent sentiment analysis research has focused on the functional relations of words using typed dependency parsing, providing a refined analysis on the grammar and semantics of textual data. Heuristics are typically used to determine the typed dependency polarity patterns, which may not comprehensively identify all possible rules. We study the use of class sequential rules (CSRs) to automatically learn the typed dependency patterns, and benchmark the performance of CSR against a heuristic method. Preliminary results show CSR leads to further improvements in classification performance achieving over 80% F1 scores in the test cases. In addition, we observe more complex relationships between words that could influence phrase sentiment polarity, and further discuss on possible approaches to handle the effects of these complex relationships.

15828;"CCE: A Chinese concept encyclopedia incorporating the expert-edited chinese concept dictionary with online cyclopedias";0;"Nian, J. and Jiang, S. and Huang, C. and Zhang, Y.";"Bag-of-words is the most common-used method in text mining tasks and many other applications. However, this method has some obvious shortcomings, such as ignoring semantic information. While in document analysis, semantic information always plays a more important role than individual words. To tackle this problem, we need to borrow semantic information from ontologies to learn the text information better. An expert-edited ontology is usually well structured and is more authoritative than an online cyclopedia. On the other hand, due to the costly editing, it is rather difficult for expert-edited ontologies to keep up with a deluge of new words. In this paper, we propose a method to construct a Chinese ontology to keep the carefully-designed structure of an expert-edited ontology, meanwhile embody new vocabulary from an online cyclopedia. We name the enhanced ontology as Chinese Concept Encyclopedia (CCE) and employ it in some text mining applications. The experimental results show that CCE outperforms the expert-edited ontology Chinese Concept Dictionary (CCD).

15838;"Document sentences as a small world";0;"Balinsky, H.a  and Balinsky, A.b  and Simske, S.c ";"In this paper we describe the possibility of constructing the well-known small world topology for an ordinary document, based on the actual document structure. Sentences in such a graph are represented by nodes, which are connected if and only if the corresponding sentences are neighbors or share at least one common keyword. This graph is built using a carefully selected one-parameter set of keywords. By varying this parameter - the level of meaningfulness - we transition the document-representing graph from a trivial path graph into a large random graph. During such a conversion, as the parameter is varied over its range, the graph becomes a small world. This in turn opens the possibility of applying many well-established ranking algorithms to the problem of ranking sentences and paragraphs in text documents. These rankings are, in turn, crucial for document understanding, summarization and information extraction. These graphs can also serve as a source of interesting small world graphs for the theory of complex networks.

15841;"A semantic information retrieval model for focused crawling";0;"Osuna-Ontiveros, D. and Lopez-Arevalo, I. and Sosa-Sosa, V.";"Nowadays, users of computers store a lot of information on the Web. For this reason, the Internet is a good place to search information on any subject. Due to the large amount of information, some users would search information on specific websites that they consider interesting (e.g. www.wikipedia.com, news sites, etc.). Traditional models represent webpages by using the frequency of terms or the structure of links in order to assign weight to terms of webpages. This paper presents a semantic information retrieval to represent specific websites. This proposal integrates text mining algorithms based on natural language processing and traditional representation models with the aim to improve the quality of webpages recovered by searching. Each webpage of the website is represented as a vector of topics, instead of a vector of terms. In a similar way, the query is represented as a vector of topics. Thus, a similarity measure can be applied over this vector and vectors of documents to retrieve the most relevant documents.

15846;"BOSS: A biomedical object search system";0;"Choi, J. and Kim, D. and Kim, S. and Lee, S. and Lee, K. and Kang, J.";"It has never been easy to search relevant information from ever increasing corpus of academic literatures. Large volume of research exists concerning this problem. The previous solutions are put on either ends of spectrum: general-purpose search and domain-specific ""deep"" search systems. The general-purpose search systems such as PubMed offer flexible query interface, but churn out a list of matching documents that users have to digest in order to find the answers to their queries. On the other hand, the ""deep"" search systems such as PPI Finder and iHOP return the precompiled results in a structured way. Their results, however, are often found only within some predefined contexts. In order to address this problem, we introduce a new search engine, BOSS, for search on biomedical objects. Unlike the conventional search systems, BOSS indexes segments, rather than documents. A segment refers to a minimal semantic unit such as phrase, clause or sentence that is semantically coherent in the given context (e.g., biomedical objects or their relations). For a user query, BOSS finds all matching segments, identifies the objects appearing in the segments, and aggregates the segments for each object. Finally, it turns up for the user the ranked list of the objects along with their matching segments. BOSS fills the gap between either ends of the spectrum by allowing users to pose context-free queries and by returning a structured set of results. Furthermore, BOSS exhibits the characteristic of good scalability, just as with conventional document search engines, because as it is designed to use a standard document-indexing model with minimal modifications. Considering the features, BOSS is believed to notch up the technological level of traditional solutions for search on biomedical information. BOSS is accessible at http://boss.korea.ac.kr.

15850;"Large-scale question classification in cQA by leveraging Wikipedia semantic knowledge";0;"Cai, L. and Zhou, G. and Liu, K. and Zhao, J.";"With the flourishing of community-based question answering (cQA) services like Yahoo! Answers, more and more web users seek their information need from these sites. Understanding users information need expressed through their search questions is crucial to information providers. Question classification in cQA is studied for this purpose. However, there are two main difficulties in applying traditional methods (question classification in TREC QA and text classification) to cQA: (1) Traditional methods confine themselves to classify a text or question into two or a few predefined categories. While in cQA, the number of categories is much larger, such as Yahoo! Answers, there contains 1,263 categories. Our empirical results show that with the increasing of the number of categories to moderate size, the performance of the classification accuracy dramatically decreases. (2) Unlike the normal texts, questions in cQA are very short, which cannot provide sufficient word co-occurrence or shared information for a good similarity measure due to the data sparseness. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach for question classification in cQA that can tackle the difficulties of the traditional methods. In the first stage, we preform a search process to prune the large-scale categories to focus our classification effort on a small subset. In the second stage, we enrich questions by leveraging Wikipedia semantic knowledge to tackle the data sparseness. As a result, the classification model is trained on the enriched small subset. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on Yahoo! Answers with 1,263 categories. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline method (with error reductions of 23.21%).

However, there has been little work on reducing the manual effort involved in the discovery of effective textual patterns for relation extraction. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to facilitate the pattern discovery for relation extraction. Specifically, we define the notion of semantic signature to represent the most salient features of a textual fragment. We then propose a novel clustering algorithm based on semantic signature, S2C, and its enhancement S2C+. Experiments on two real-world data sets show that, when compared with k-means clustering, S2C and S2C+ are at least an order of magnitude faster, while generating high quality clusters that are at least comparable to the best clusters generated by k-means without requiring any manual tuning. Finally, a user study confirms that our clustering-based approach can indeed help users discover effective textual patterns for relation extraction with only a fraction of the manual effort required by the conventional approach.

15852;"Transferring topical knowledge from auxiliary long texts for short text clustering";0;"Jin, O.a  and Liu, N.N.b  and Zhao, K.c  and Yu, Y.a  and Yang, Q.b ";"With the rapid growth of social Web applications such as Twitter and online advertisements, the task of understanding short texts is becoming more and more important. Most traditional text mining techniques are designed to handle long text documents. For short text messages, many of the existing techniques are not effective due to the sparseness of text representations. To understand short messages, we observe that it is often possible to find topically related long texts, which can be utilized as the auxiliary data when mining the target short texts data. In this article, we present a novel approach to cluster short text messages via transfer learning from auxiliary long text data. We show that while some previous work exists that enhance short text clustering with related long texts, most of them ignore the semantic and topical inconsistencies between the target and auxiliary data and hurt the clustering performance. To accommodate the possible inconsistency between source and target data, we propose a novel topic model - Dual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DLDA) model, which jointly learns two sets of topics on short and long texts and couples the topic parameters to cope with the potential inconsistency between data sets. We demonstrate through large-scale clustering experiments on both advertisements and Twitter data that we can obtain superior performance over several state-of-art techniques for clustering short text documents.

With a large number of messages appearing in user interfaces, it hinders user accessibility to useful information buried in disorganized, incomplete, and unstructured text messages. In order to enhance user accessibility, we propose to aggregate related microblogging messages into clusters and automatically assign them semantically meaningful labels. However, a distinctive feature of microblogging messages is that they are much shorter than conventional text documents. These messages provide inadequate term co occurrence information for capturing semantic associations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for organizing unstructured microblogging messages by transforming them to a semantically structured representation. The proposed framework first captures informative tree fragments by analyzing a parse tree of the message, and then exploits external knowledge bases (Wikipedia and WordNet) to enhance their semantic information. Empirical evaluation on a Twitter dataset shows that our framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

15856;"A cross-domain adaptation method for sentiment classification using probabilistic latent analysis";0;"Gao, S. and Li, H.";"Sentiment classification is becoming attractive in recent years because of its potential commercial applications. It exploits supervised learning methods to learn the classifiers from the annotated training documents. The challenge in sentiment classification lies in that the sentiment domains are diverse, heterogeneous and fast-growing. The classifiers trained on one domain (source domain) could not classify a document from another domain (target domain). The domain adaptation technique is to address the problem by making use of labeled samples in the source domain, and unlabeled samples in the target domain. This paper presents a new solution, a cross-domain topic indexing (CDTI) method, with which a common semantic space is found from the prior between-domain term correspondences and the term co-occurrences in the cross-domain documents. These observations are characterized with the mixture model in CDTI, with each component being a possible topic shared by the source and target domains. Such common topics are found to index the cross-domain content. We evaluate the algorithms on a multi-domain sentiment classification task, which shows that CDTI outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation method, i.e. spectral feature alignment (SFA), and the traditional latent semantic indexing method.

To reduce the human input and to give more reliance to automatic plagiarism detectors, we propose an Intelligent Plagiarism Reasoner (iPlag), which works by combining several analytical procedures. Scholarly documents under investigation are segmented into logical tree-structured representation using a procedure called D-SEGMENT. Statistical methods are utilised to assign numerical weights to structural components under a technique called C-WEIGHT. Relevance ranking (R-RANK) and plagiarism screening approaches (P-SCREEN) are adjusted to incorporate structural weights, citation evidences, syntax-based and semantic-based methods into plagiarism detection results. We encourage current plagiarism detection systems to adapt the proposed framework.

15865;"Semantic category analysis of poetry and prose";0;"St.quinton, J.G.";"The human mind creates and interprets beautiful literature. Perhaps one of the greatest challenges for Machine Intelligence is the replication of those skills. Semantic Category Theory indicates that human language cognition is based upon four distinct data types that can be combined in one of two ways. The analytical adjunct to Semantic Category Theory, Semantic Category Analysis, determines the specific data types and interaction modes involved in any spoken or written text. This paper illustrates the Semantic Category Analysis of human-created Poetry and Prose. The paper further demonstrates how the tenets of Semantic Category Theory form a basis for the Machine-creation of Poetry and Prose; a requisite for comprehensive Human-Machine dialogue.

15867;"Using negation and phrases in inducing rules for text classification";0;"Chua, S. and Coenen, F. and Malcolm, G. and Fernando, M. and Constantino, G.";"An investigation into the use of negation in Inductive Rule Learning (IRL) for text classification is described. The use of negated features in the IRL process has been shown to improve effectiveness of classification. However, although in the case of small datasets it is perfectly feasible to include the potential negation of all possible features as part of the feature space, this is not possible for datasets that include large numbers of features such as those used in text mining applications. Instead a process whereby features to be negated can be identified dynamically is required. Such a process is described in the paper and compared with established techniques (JRip, NaiveBayes, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), OlexGreedy). The work is also directed at an approach to text classification based on a ""bag of phrases"" representation; the motivation here being that a phrase contains semantic information that is not present in single keyword. In addition, a given text corpus typically contains many more key-phrase features than keyword features, therefore, providing more potential features to be negated.

Existing metrics evaluate pair wise text similarity based on text content, which is referred as content similarity. The performances of these measures are based on co-occurrences, and ignore the semantics among words. Although, several research works have been carried out to solve this problem, we propose a novel similarity measure by exploiting external knowledge base-Wikipedia to enhance document clustering task. Wikipedia articles and the main categories were used to predict and affiliate them to their semantic concepts. In this measure, we incorporate context similarity by constructing a vector with each dimension representing contents similarity between a document and other documents in the collection. Experimental result conducted on TREC blog dataset confirms that the use of context similarity measure, can improve the precision of document clustering significantly.

It is therefore difficult for a single classifier to efficiently handle multi-level categorization of such a varied document space. In this paper we analyse methods to enhance the efficiency of a single classifier for two-level classification by combining it with classifiers of other types. We use the maximum significance value as an indicator for the subspace of a test document. We represent the documents using the conditional significance vector which increases the distinction between classes within a subspace. Our experiments show that dividing a document space into different semantic subspaces increases the efficiency of such hybrid classifier combinations. Applying different types of classifiers on different subspaces substantially improves overall learning.

Information is generated and managed through either computer or mobile devices by one person and consumed by many other persons. Most of these user generated content are textual information, as Social Networks(Facebook, LinkedIn), Microblogging(Twitter), blogs(Blogspot, Wordpress). Looking for valuable nuggets of knowledge, such as capturing and summarizing sentiments from these huge amount of data could help users make informed decisions. In this paper, we develop a sentiment identification system called SES which implements three different sentiment identification algorithms. We augment basic compositional semantic rules in the first algorithm. In the second algorithm, we think sentiment should not be simply classified as positive, negative, and objective but a continuous score to reflect sentiment degree. All word scores are calculated based on a large volume of customer reviews. Due to the special characteristics of social media texts, we propose a third algorithm which takes emoticons, negation word position, and domain-specific words into account. Furthermore, a machine learning model is employed on features derived from outputs of three algorithms. We conduct our experiments on user comments from Facebook and tweets from twitter. The results show that utilizing Random Forest will acquire a better accuracy than decision tree, neural network, and logistic regression. We also propose a flexible way to represent document sentiment based on sentiments of each sentence contained. SES is available online.

15878;"TPEMatcher: A tool for searching in parsed text corpora";0;"Choi, Y.S.";"Recently, due to the widespread on-line availability of syntactically annotated text corpora, some automated tools for searching in such text corpora have gained great attention. Generally, those conventional corpus search tools use a decomposition-matching-merging method based on relational predicates for matching a tree pattern query to the desired parts of text corpora. Thus, their query formulation and expressivity are often complicated due to poorly understood query formalisms, and their searching tasks may require a big computational overhead due to a large number of repeated trials of matching tree patterns. To overcome these difficulties, we present TPEMatcher, a tool for searching in parsed text corpora. TPEMatcher provides not only an efficient way of query formulation and searching but also a good query expressivity based on concise syntax and semantics of tree pattern query.

If we want machines to really understand natural language, we need to provide them with this kind of knowledge rather than relying on the valence of keywords and word co-occurrence frequencies.

15885;"Measuring semantic relatedness using wikipedia revision information in a signed network";0;"Yang, W.-T. and Kao, H.-Y.";"Identifying the semantic relatedness of two words is an important task for the information retrieval, natural language processing, and text mining. However, due to the diversity of meaning for a word, the semantic relatedness of two words is still hard to precisely evaluate under the limited corpora. Nowadays, Wikipedia is now a huge and wiki-based encyclopedia on the internet that has become a valuable resource for research work. Wikipedia articles, written by a live collaboration of user editors, contain a high volume of reference links, URL identification for concepts and a complete revision history. Moreover, each Wikipedia article represents an individual concept that simultaneously contains other concepts that are hyperlinks of other articles embedded in its content. Through this, we believe that the semantic relatedness between two words can be found through the semantic relatedness between two Wikipedia articles. Therefore, we propose an Editor-Contribution-based Rank (ECR) algorithm for ranking the concepts in the articles content through all revisions and take the ranked concepts as a vector representing the article. We classify four types of relationship in which the behavior of addition and deletion maps appropriate and inappropriate concepts. ECR ranks those concepts depending on the mutual signed-reinforcement relationship between the concepts and the editors. The results reveal that our method leads to prominent performance improvement and increases the correlation coefficient by a factor ranging from 4% to 23% over previous methods that calculate the relatedness between two articles.

15886;"A web content mining approach for tag cloud generation";0;"Abulaish, M. and Anwar, T.";"Tag cloud, also known as word cloud, are very useful for quickly perceiving the most prominent terms embedded within a text collection to determine their relative prominence. The effectiveness of tag clouds to conceptualize a text corpus is directly proportional to the quality of the keyphrases extracted from the corpus. Although, authors provide a list of about five to ten keywords in scientific publications that are used to map them into their respective domain, due to exponential growth in non-scientific documents on the World Wide Web, an automatic mechanism is sought to identify keyphrases embedded within them for tag cloud generation. In this paper, we propose a web content mining technique to extract keyphrases from web documents for tag cloud generation. Instead of using partial or full parsing, the proposed method applies n-gram technique followed by various heuristics-based refinements to identify a set of lexical and semantic features from text documents. We propose a rich set of domain-independent features to model candidate keyphrases very effectively for establishing their keyphraseness using classification models.

15892;"Mining service integration opportunities towards joined-up government";0;"Basanya, R.a  b  and Ojo, A.a ";"Service integration is central to joined-up government initiatives and requires information on the collaborators and the services they offer, roles of different actors, the resources required, and their goals (individual and shared). These information are largely available in unstructured forms on government portals, publications and other textural sources. This paper explores semantic text mining for extracting service-related information from such sources using Natural Language Processing techniques supported by Service-Oriented Process Ontologies. Our solution framework consists of the following steps: (1) creating domain and service-oriented process ontology, (2) extracting service related information from textual sources based on the ontology, and finally (3) mining relationship among the services based on the extracted information in Step 2 linked with a pre-defined hierarchy of service delivery goals specifying the objective(s) to be achieved among the orchestrated services. We describe our approach to these tasks and discuss the progress of the work, our experiences and the challenges encountered so far.

15895;"Feature selection algorithm based on the Community discovery";0;"Jia, X.";"In order to overcome the SVM for text classification ignoring the context of semantic information and the use of a community to text classification, one boundary point can only belong to a community of view, the concept of contribution and overlapping coefficient based on the complex network diagram is introduced. And feature selection algorithm based on community discovery is proposed. Experiments show that the algorithm can remain the text in the context of semantic information, which is more reasonable to divide the boundary points into the community. Then in the Bayesian classifier validate the algorithm performance in the recall, precision and F1 values. The result shows that the algorithm performance is superior to MIDF, and has a good flexibility in text classification.

15901;"Concept signatures and semantic drift";0;"Gulla, J.A.a  and Solskinnsbakk, G.a  and Myrseth, P.b  and Haderlein, V.b  and Cerrato, O.b ";"Ontology evolution is the process of incrementally and consistently adapting an existing ontology to changes in the relevant domain. Semantic drift refers to how ontology concepts intentions gradually change as the domain evolves. Normally, a semantic drift captures small domain changes that are hard to detect with traditional ontology management tools or ontology learning methods, but may be important to the maintenance of the ontology. This paper discusses a new approach to detecting semantic drift that makes use of concept signatures reflecting the textual references to concepts over time. Comparing how signatures change over time, we see how concepts semantic content evolves and how their relationships to other concepts gradually reflect these changes. An experiment with the DNVs business sector ontology from 2004 and 2008 demonstrates the value of this approach to ontology evolution.

Manual approaches to detecting and analyzing fake reviews (i.e., spam) are not practical due to the problem of information overload. However, the design and development of automated methods of detecting fake reviews is a challenging research problem. The main reason is that fake reviews are specifically composed to mislead readers, so they may appear the same as legitimate reviews (i.e., ham). As a result, discriminatory features that would enable individual reviews to be classified as spam or ham may not be available. Guided by the design science research methodology, the main contribution of this study is the design and instantiation of novel computational models for detecting fake reviews. In particular, a novel text mining model is developed and integrated into a semantic language model for the detection of untruthful reviews. The models are then evaluated based on a real-world dataset collected from amazon.com. The results of our experiments confirm that the proposed models outperform other well-known baseline models in detecting fake reviews. To the best of our knowledge, the work discussed in this article represents the first successful attempt to apply text mining methods and semantic language models to the detection of fake consumer reviews. A managerial implication of our research is that firms can apply our design artifacts to monitor online consumer reviews to develop effective marketing or product design strategies based on genuine consumer feedback posted to the Internet.

It incorporates semantic analysis and text mining techniques for processing and analyzing the patent documents. The method differentiates itself from the traditional technological management tools in its knowledge base. Instead of eliciting knowledge from domain experts, the proposed method adopts global patent databases as sources of knowledge. The system enables users to search for existing patent documents or relevant IP documents which are related to a potential new invention and to support invention by providing the relationships and patterns among a group of IP documents. The method has been evaluated by benchmarking with the performance against traditional text mining technique and has successfully been implemented at a selected reference site. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

15943;"Proposing a new method for ontology population";0;"Papi, A.R.a  and Nassiri, R.b  and Mohsenzadeh, M.a  and Jafarbekloo, Z.c ";"With the advent of the Semantic Web aims to inject a meaning in the current Web, application of ontology as one of its layers, emerged more than past. Lack of the necessary tools and researches in this field reveals the need of this work. Due to problems with the methods based on syntactic - lexical patterns, the need for this research in order to find a method, based on ranking of the concepts is more visible. Method presented in this paper, could be applied in the fields of, information retrieval, text mining, query systems developers, developing semantic dictionaries such as WorldNet and etc. In this paper a new method for assigning instances to the concepts in ontology will be presented.

15945;"Term similarity and weighting framework for text representation";0;"Sani, S. and Wiratunga, N. and Massie, S. and Lothian, R.";"Expressiveness of natural language is a challenge for text representation since the same idea can be expressed in many different ways. Therefore, terms in a document should not be treated independently of one another since together they help to disambiguate and establish meaning. Term-similarity measures are often used to improve representation by capturing semantic relationships between terms. Another consideration for representation involves the importance of terms. Feature selection techniques address this by using statistical measures to quantify term usefulness for retrieval. In this paper we present a framework that combines term-similarity and weighting for text representation. This allows us to comparatively study the impact of term similarity, term weighting and any synergistic effect that may exist between them. Study of term similarity is based on approaches that exploit term co-occurrences within document and sentence contexts whilst term weighting uses the popular Chi-squared test. Our results on text classification tasks show that the combined effect of similarity and weighting is superior to each technique independently and that this synergistic effect is obtained regardless of co-occurrence context granularity.

The quality of a review can be determined by identifying how relevant it is to the work that the review was written for as well as its similarity to existing well-written and coherent reviews.

15947;"Mining collaboration opportunities to support Joined-Up Government";0;"Basanya, R.a  b  and Ojo, A.a  and Janowski, T.a  and Turini, F.b ";"Governments strive to achieve improvements in delivering public services, developing and implementing public policies, responding to crisis situations, and optimizing the use of public resources, among others. Achieving such goals requires collaboration across different levels and functions of government, and across public and private sectors in a Joined-Up Government. Establishing such collaboration requires information on prospective participants including their goals, resources, processes and services. Such information is rarely available in structured forms e.g. in databases, but instead scattered over government portals, publications and other textual sources. This paper proposes the use of semantic text mining for extracting collaboration-related information (focusing on government collaboration) from unstructured data sources. The proposed solution applies natural language processing techniques supported by the relevant domain and process ontologies. It consists of three steps: 1) extracting process-related information from textual sources, 2) creating process ontology instances from extracted information and 3) mining shared and integrated processes based on process instances and the service goal hierarchy in the domain ontology. The paper describes the rationale of and approach adopted in this research, the progress achieved in implementing step 1, the challenges encountered and how we intend to address them in pursuing subsequent steps.

15949;"An EM clustering algorithm which produces a dual representation";0;"Kim, S. and Wilbur, W.J.";"Clustering text documents is an important step in mining useful information on the Web or other text-based resources. The common task in text clustering is to handle text in a multi-dimensional space, and to partition documents into groups, where each group contains documents that are similar to each other. However, this strategy lacks a comprehensive view for humans since it cannot explain the subject of each cluster. Utilizing semantic information such as an ontology can solve this problem, but it needs a well-defined database or pre-labeled gold standard set. In this paper, we present a theme-based clustering algorithm for text documents. Given text, subject terms are extracted and used for clustering documents in a probabilistic framework. An EM approach is used to ensure documents are assigned to correct themes, hence it converges to an optimal solution. The proposed method is distinctive because its results are sufficiently explanatory for human understanding as well as efficient for usual clustering performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the extracted themes represent well the topics of clusters on the MEDLINEÂ® dataset.

15951;"Enhancing information retrieval efficiency using semantic-based-combined- similarity-measure";0;"Saini, M.a  and Sharma, D.b  and Gupta, P.K.c ";"Most of the knowledge intensive organizations are having their information resided in large text document repositories and most of these text repositories and databases are either unstructured or semi-structured. Recently various soft computing techniques have been used to improve information retrieval efficiency. More specifically genetic algorithms have been used for various information retrieval components like matching function learning, documents clustering, information extraction, query optimization [1 - 6]. In most of the cases in information retrieval matching function is based on term frequency. But the problem with this approach is that the syntactic information of the text document is lost and phrases are also not considered, so results in poor accuracy. In this paper we have proposed a new semantic based similarity measure in which each term can be a phrase or a single word and the weight assigned to each term is based on its semantic importance considering each sentence. We have used this semantic similarity measure along with other standard similarity measure as Jaccard and cosine to form the semantic-based-combined-similarity- measure. Standard genetic algorithm has been used to optimize the weight given for each similarity measure.

15956;"Sentiment analysis of text-to-speech input using latent affective mapping";0;"Bellegarda, J.R.";"To impart a congruent emotional quality to synthetic speech, it is expedient to leverage the overall polarity of the input text. This is feasible inasmuch as speech generation complies with the outcome of sentiment analysis. We have recently introduced latent affective mapping [1]-[3], a new approach to emotion detection which exploits two separate levels of semantic information: one that encapsulates the foundations of the domain considered, and one that specifically accounts for the overall affective fabric of the language. The ensuing framework exposes the emergent relationship between these two levels in order to advantageously inform affective evaluation. This paper applies latent affective mapping to the narrower problem of sentiment analysis, in order to achieve a more robust identification of the polarity of textual data. Empirical evidence gathered on the ""Affective Text"" portion of the SemEval-2007 corpus [4] shows that this approach is promising for automatic sentiment prediction in text. This bodes well as a first step in ensuring emotional congruence in text-to-speech synthesis.

15959;"Training a hierarchical classifier based on the global information of the category tree";0;"Zhu, C.a  and Ma, J.b ";"One common approach in hierarchical text classification (HTC) involves associating classifiers with nodes in the category tree T and classifying documents in a top-down manner. Training a hierarchical classifier is to choose the suitable classifier and its parameters at each node of T because the features of data in different classes are usually distinct. Until now all known approaches suffer from so-called blocking problem and ignore the hierarchical semantic relationships among subcategories in training classifier. In this paper we propose a novel methodology to train a hierarchical classifier that takes both above two problems into account. The approach will punish the classifier that wrongly classified documents in the last run and update the weights of the wrongly classified samples according to the levels they locate at T. The aim of the training process is to let the defined whole loss function of the classification be the minimized. Experiments on two collections show that the trained classifier outperforms the traditional AdaBoost in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and microPrecision.

15974;"A latent semantic analysis-based approach to geographic feature categorization from text";0;"Huang, Y.";"Geographic feature categorization from text addresses the need for querying and finding geographic features from text documents. Although many text classification techniques have been developed, there are limitations to apply to geographic features due to the uniqueness of the geography features. In this paper we propose a method to classify geographic features based on latent semantic analysis and domain knowledge. The empirical experiment indicates that the proposed method achieves satisfactory categorizing effectiveness.

15975;"Feature distance-based framework for classification of low-frequency semantic relations";0;"Horie, A.K. and Ishizuka, M.";"In the relation extraction of semantic relations, it is not uncommon to face settings in which the training data provides very few instances of some relation classes. This is mostly due to the high cost of producing such data and to the class imbalance problem, which may result in some classes presenting small frequencies even with a large annotated corpus. This work thus presents a semi-supervised bootstrapped method to expand this initial training dataset, using pattern matching to extract new candidate instances from the Web. The core of this process uses a multiview feature distance-based framework, which allows quantitative and qualitative analysis of intermediate steps of the process. Experimental results show that this framework provides better results in the relation classification task than the baseline, and the bootstrapped architecture improves the relation classification task as a whole for these low-frequency semantic relations settings.

15978;"Learning semantic content-based profiles for cross-language recommendations";0;"Lops, P. and Musto, C. and Narducci, F. and De Gemmis, M. and Basile, P. and Semeraro, G.";"The exponential growth of the Web is the most influential factor that contributes to the increasing importance of cross-lingual text retrieval and filtering systems. Indeed, relevant information exists in different languages, thus users need to find documents in languages different from the one the query is formulated in. In this context, an emerging requirement is to sift through the increasing flood of multilingual text: this poses a renewed challenge for designing effective multilingual Information Filtering systems. Content-based filtering systems adapt their behavior to individual users by learning their preferences from documents that were already deemed relevant. The learning process aims to construct a profile of the user that can be later exploited in selecting/recommending relevant items. User profiles are generally represented using keywords in a specific language. For example, if a user likes movies whose plots are written in Italian, a content-based filtering algorithm will learn a profile for that user which contains Italian words, thus failing in recommending movies whose plots are written in English, although they might be definitely interesting. Moreover, keywords suffer of typical Information Retrieval-related problems such as polysemy and synonymy. In this paper, we propose a language-independent content-based recommender system, called MARS (MultilAnguage Recommender System), that builds cross-language user profiles, by shifting the traditional text representation based on keywords, to a more complex language-independent representation based on word meanings. The proposed strategy relies on a knowledge-based word sense disambiguation technique that exploits MultiWordNet as sense inventory. As a consequence, content-based user profiles become language-independent and can be exploited for recommending items represented in a language different from the one used in the content-based user profile. Experiments conducted in a movie recommendation scenario show the effectiveness of the approach.

15982;"Sentence-level sentiment polarity classification using a linguistic approach";0;"Tan, L.K.-W.a  and Na, J.-C.a  and Theng, Y.-L.a  and Chang, K.b ";"Recent sentiment analysis research has focused on the functional relations of words using typed dependency parsing as this provides a refined analysis on the grammar and semantics of the textual data, which could improve performance. However, typed dependencies only provide the grammatical relationships between individual words while there exist more complex relationships between words that could influence a sentence sentiment polarity. In this paper, we propose a linguistic approach, called Polarity Prediction Model (PPM), that combines typed dependencies and subjective phrase analysis to detect sentence-level sentiment polarity. Our approach also considers the intensity of words and domain terms that could influence the sentiment polarity output. PPM is shown to provide a fine-grained analysis for handling and explaining the complex relationships between words in detecting a sentence sentiment polarity. PPM was found to consistently outperform a baseline model by 5% in terms of overall F1-score, and exceeding 10% in terms of positive F1-score when compared to a Typed-dependency only approach.

15984;"An improved sentence polishing model used in automatic extraction";0;"Wu, Y.a  and Li, X.a  and Xu, R.b  and Yao, L.a ";"Language modeling plays a critical role for automatic extraction. Typically, the statistical model of automatic extraction suffers from the lack of the subject semantic consistency between sentences and the redundancy of information. In this study, we first introduce our work on automatic extraction, and then analyze the disadvantages of different extracting models. We then present a advanced mathematical model to overcome these lacks based on computational linguistics. As shown by experiments, the proposed modeling and methods can significantly reduce the redundancy of information and increase the subject semantic consistency between sentences of automatic abstraction with moderate computational cost.

This way, extracted communities can be labeled according to latent semantic information within documents, called topics.

15988;"Fast text categorization based on collaborative work in the semantic and class spaces";0;"Zheng, W.-B.a  b  and Zhang, H.b  and Qian, Y.-T.a ";"The blooming of the Internet information has made fast text categorization very essential. Generally, in order to accelerate the classification process, the classifier needs to be simplified as much as possible; however, the accuracy might descend drastically in that case, This paper proposes a novel approach to achieve a suitable tradeoff between the speed and accuracy. With category information fusion and basis orthogonality non-negative matrix factorization, the documents can be mapped from the term space to a semantic or class s-pace, and a simple and fast classification method in the class space is proposed. Furthermore a criterion for re-classifying in the semantic space is discussed. Finally, the collaborative work framework in the semantic and class spaces is implemented. Experiments in two benchmarks are presented, and the results are encouraging.

However, manually constructing semantic classes is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. In this paper, we present an algorithm for induction of Chinese semantic classes from natural language text based on coordinate patterns. First, several coordinate patterns are proposed to harvest high-quality coordinate instance. Second, an iterative clustering process is used to cluster words into semantic classes. The clustering process mainly used coordinate relation between words. Experiment results show that the proposed approach performs relatively well and achieves 53.2% in terms of precision. Finally, a thesaurus containing about 15000 Chinese words is generated automatically.

15992;"Overview of cognitive visualisation";0;"Mooranian, M. and Dillon, T. and Chang, E.";"Since the beginning of mankind, there has been a need to display knowledge in such a way that it could be easily understood. In todays highly technological world we face an overwhelming amount of information from a variety of sources, namely: business applications such as customer comments and communications, trade publications, internal research reports and competitor web sites. Most of this knowledge is stored in textual format so in order to conceptually visualize this information, we need to extract the knowledge it contains and then try to comprehend it. However, one of the characteristics of textual information is its unstructured format which is not readily assimilated and understood. This paper presents a summary of current techniques used in information visualization. We present some of the main visual text analytics systems, highlighting their techniques, in addition to providing a brief overview of visual text analytics, semantic analysis of text and ontology that could be used to facilitate the process of cognitive visualization.

15993;"Transfer latent semantic learning: Microblog mining with less supervision";0;"Zhang, D.a  and Liu, Y.b  and Lawrence, R.D.c  and Chenthamarakshan, V.c ";"The increasing volume of information generated on microblogging sites such as Twitter raises several challenges to traditional text mining techniques. First, most texts from those sites are abbreviated due to the constraints of limited characters in one post; second, the input usually comes in streams of large-volumes. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop effective and efficient representations of abbreviated texts for better filtering and mining. In this paper, we introduce a novel transfer learning approach, namely transfer latent semantic learning, that utilizes a large number of related tagged documents with rich information from other sources (source domain) to help build a robust latent semantic space for the abbreviated texts (target domain). This is achieved by simultaneously minimizing the document reconstruction error and the classification error of the labeled examples from the source domain by building a classifier with hinge loss in the latent semantic space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying them to the task of classifying and tagging abbreviated texts. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real application datasets, including Reuters-21578 and Twitter data, suggest substantial improvements using our approach over existing ones.

15994;"Applying Semantic Suffix Net to suffix tree clustering";0;"Janruang, J. and Guha, S.";"In this paper we consider the problem of clustering snippets returned from search engines. We propose a technique to invoke semantic similarity in the clustering process. Our technique improves on the well-known STC method, which is a highly efficient heuristic for clustering web search results. However, a weakness of STC is that it cannot cluster semantic similar documents. To solve this problem, we propose a new data structure to represent suffixes of a single string, called a Semantic Suffix Net (SSN). A generalized semantic suffix net is created to represent suffixes of a set of strings by using a new operator to partially combine nets. A key feature of this new operator is to find a joint point by using semantic similarity and string matching; net pairs combination then begins at that joint point. This logic causes the number of nodes and branches of a generalized semantic suffix net to decrease. The operator then uses the line of suffix links as a boundary to separate the net. A generalized semantic suffix net is then incorporated into the STC algorithm so that it can cluster semantically similar snippets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves upon conventional STC.

15995;"Tuning semantic association for modelling textual data";0;"Otero, J.M.a  and RodrÃ­guez, A.Y.b  and Medina-Pagola, J.E.b ";"Text information processing depends critically on the proper representation of documents. Traditional models, like the vector space model, have significant limitations because they do not consider semantic relations amongst terms. Global Association Distance Model (GADM) is an alternative that includes this consideration for document representation, assuming basically that two documents should be closer if the shortest formal distances amongst terms in each document are similar. The association strength function used to model the semantic relations among terms, based on its formal distances is a critical feature of GADM.

Our methodology involved using the OpenDMAP semantic parser with manually written rules. The original OpenDMAP system was updated for this challenge with a broad ontology defined for the events of interest, new linguistic patterns for those events, and specialized coordination handling. We achieved state-of-the-art precision for two of the three tasks, scoring the highest of 24 teams at precision of 71.81 on Task 1 and the highest of 6 teams at precision of 70.97 on Task 2. We provide a detailed analysis of the training data and show that a number of trigger words were ambiguous as to event type, even when their arguments are constrained by semantic class. The data is also shown to have a number of missing annotations. Analysis of a sampling of the comparatively small number of false positives returned by our system shows that major causes of this type of error were failing to recognize second themes in two-theme events, failing to recognize events when they were the arguments to other events, failure to recognize nontheme arguments, and sentence segmentation errors. We show that specifically handling coordination had a small but important impact on the overall performance of the system. The OpenDMAP system and the rule set are available at.

15999;"A web search engine-based approach to measure semantic similarity between words";0;"Bollegala, D.a  and Matsuo, Y.b  and Ishizuka, M.a ";"Measuring the semantic similarity between words is an important component in various tasks on the web such as relation extraction, community mining, document clustering, and automatic metadata extraction. Despite the usefulness of semantic similarity measures in these applications, accurately measuring semantic similarity between two words (or entities) remains a challenging task. We propose an empirical method to estimate semantic similarity using page counts and text snippets retrieved from a web search engine for two words. Specifically, we define various word co-occurrence measures using page counts and integrate those with lexical patterns extracted from text snippets. To identify the numerous semantic relations that exist between two given words, we propose a novel pattern extraction algorithm and a pattern clustering algorithm. The optimal combination of page counts-based co-occurrence measures and lexical pattern clusters is learned using support vector machines. The proposed method outperforms various baselines and previously proposed web-based semantic similarity measures on three benchmark data sets showing a high correlation with human ratings. Moreover, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in a community mining task.

16005;"Utilizing Hubel Wiesel models for semantic associations and topics extraction from unstructured text";0;"Tiwari, S.a  and Ramanathan, K.b ";"There is a desire to extract and make better use of unstructured textual information available on the web. Semantic cognition opens new avenues in the utilization of this information. In this research, we extended the Hubel Wiesel model of hierarchical visual representation to extract semantic information from text. The unstructured text was preprocessed to a suitable input for Hubel Wiesel model. The threshold at each layer for neuronal growth was chosen as a ramp function of the level. Probabilistic approach was used for all post processing steps like prediction, word association, labeling, gist extraction etc. Equivalence with the Topics model was used to arrive at conditional probabilities in our model. We validated our model on three datasets and the model generated reasonable semantic associations. We evaluated the model based on top level clustering, label generation and word association.

16007;"Text clustering based on granular computing and Wikipedia";0;"Jing, L. and Yu, J.";"Text clustering plays an important role in many real-world applications, but it is faced with various challenges, such as, curse of dimensionality, complex semantics and large volume. A lot of researches paid attention to deal with such problems by designing new text representation models and clustering algorithms. However, text clustering still remains a research problem due to the complicated properties of text data. In this paper, a text clustering procedure is proposed based on the principle of granular computing with the aid of Wikipedia. The proposed clustering method firstly identifies the text granules, especially focusing on concepts and words with the aid of Wikipedia. And then, it mines the latent patterns based on the computation of such granules. Experimental results on benchmark data sets (20Newsgroups and Reuters-21578) have shown that the proposed method improves the performance of text clustering by comparing with the existing clustering algorithm together with the existing representation models.

16008;"Dimensionality reduction with category information fusion and non-negative matrix factorization for text categorization";0;"Zheng, W.a  b  and Qian, Y.a  and Tang, H.c  d ";"Dimensionality reduction can efficiently improve computing performance of classifiers in text categorization, and non-negative matrix factorization could map the high dimensional term space into a low dimensional semantic subspace easily. Meanwhile, the non-negative of the basis vectors could provide a meaningful explanation for the semantic subspace. However, it usually could not achieve a satisfied classification performance because it is sensitive to the noise, data missing and outlier as a linear reconstruction method. This paper proposes a novel approach in which the train text and its category information are fused and a transformation matrix that maps the term space into a semantic subspace is obtained by a basis orthogonality non-negative matrix factorization and truncation. Finally, the dimensionality can be reduced aggressively with these transformations. Experimental results show that the proposed approach remains a good classification performance in a very low dimensional case.

16010;"Improve VSM text classification by title vector based document representation method";0;"Xia, T. and Du, Y.";"Text Classification is a daunting task because it is difficult to extract the semantics of natural language texts. Many problems must be resolved before natural-language processing techniques can be effectively applied to a large collection of texts. A significant one is to extract semantic information from corpus in plan text. In Vector Space Model, a document is conceptually represented by a vector of terms extracted from each document, with associated weights representing the importance of each term in the document and within the whole document collection. Likewise, an unclassified document is also modeled as a list of terms with associated weights representing the importance of the terms in it. Many techniques introduces much statistical information of terms to represent their semantic information. However, as always, document title is not taken into special consideration, while it obviously contains much semantic information. This paper proposes Title Vector to address this issue.

16011;"Latent Semantic Indexing of PubMed abstracts for identification of transcription factor candidates from microarray derived gene sets";0;"Roy, S.a  and Heinrich, K.d  and Phan, V.a  b  and Berry, M.W.e  and Homayouni, R.b  c ";"Background: Identification of transcription factors (TFs) responsible for modulation of differentially expressed genes is a key step in deducing gene regulatory pathways. Most current methods identify TFs by searching for presence of DNA binding motifs in the promoter regions of co-regulated genes. However, this strategy may not always be useful as presence of a motif does not necessarily imply a regulatory role. Conversely, motif presence may not be required for a TF to regulate a set of genes. Therefore, it is imperative to include functional (biochemical and molecular) associations, such as those found in the biomedical literature, into algorithms for identification of putative regulatory TFs that might be explicitly or implicitly linked to the genes under investigation.Results: In this study, we present a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) based text mining approach for identification and ranking of putative regulatory TFs from microarray derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Two LSI models were built using different term weighting schemes to devise pair-wise similarities between 21,027 mouse genes annotated in the Entrez Gene repository. Amongst these genes, 433 were designated TFs in the TRANSFAC database. The LSI derived TF-to-gene similarities were used to calculate TF literature enrichment p-values and rank the TFs for a given set of genes. We evaluated our approach using five different publicly available microarray datasets focusing on TFs Rel, Stat6, Ddit3, Stat5 and Nfic. In addition, for each of the datasets, we constructed gold standard TFs known to be functionally relevant to the study in question. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves showed that the log-entropy LSI model outperformed the tf-normal LSI model and a benchmark co-occurrence based method for four out of five datasets, as well as motif searching approaches, in identifying putative TFs.Conclusions: Our results suggest that our LSI based text mining approach can complement existing approaches used in systems biology research to decipher gene regulatory networks by providing putative lists of ranked TFs that might be explicitly or implicitly associated with sets of DEGs derived from microarray experiments. In addition, unlike motif searching approaches, LSI based approaches can reveal TFs that may indirectly regulate genes.

16012;"What is the basic semantic unit of chinese language? A computational approach based on topic models";0;"Zhao, Q.a  and Qin, Z.a  b  and Wan, T.b ";"Chinese language has been generally regarded as a Subject-Verb -Object (SVO) language and the basic semantic unit is the Chinese word that is usually consisted by two or more Chinese characters. However, word-centered structure of Chinese language has been controversial in linguistics. Some recent research in computational linguistics in Chinese language suggests that the character-based models perform better than the word-based models in some applications such word segmentation. In this paper, the word-based topic models and the character-based models are tested for modeling Chinese language, respectively. By empirical studies, we demonstrated the effectiveness of using Chinese characters as the basic semantic units. These two models have close performance in text classifications while the character-based model has a better quality in language modeling and a much smaller vocabulary. By testing on a bilingual corpus, three independent topic models based on Chinese words, Chinese characters and English words are trained and compared to each other. we verify the capability of topic models in modeling semantics by experiments across Chinese and English. The classification accuracy can also be boosted up by aggregating the classification results from the three independent topic models.

16016;"Segmenting eBay item descriptions into coherent sections";0;"Mukund, S.a  and Indurkhya, N.b  and Sundaresan, N.b ";"Item descriptions on an online e-Commerce site such as eBay consist of item-specific information along with generic information such as shipping and return policies, requests for feedback, and contact information. Extracting these textual segments from the item descriptions is non-trivial as they contain html markups, advertisements, templates, and navigational elements. Since sellers have considerable editorial freedom in how to describe their items, many of the descriptions lack homogeneity and compactness. Very often, the relevant information has to be extracted from incomplete, ill-formed discourse units adding to the challenge of finding coherent segments. In this paper we describe an approach that identifies item-specific text segments from eBay descriptions. This approach uses a bootstrapping technique to learn high-quality semantic lexicons for item-agnostic text segments. We first extract useful text by removing html markups using a boiler-plate removal technique that preserves markup information and captures visual segmentation. Each segment is further processed to extract discourse units that play the same role as sentences. This is followed by a clustering technique that identifies thematic breaks to extract coherent segments. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of descriptions and show that our approach outperforms a commonly-used approach that relies only on the title keywords.

Such systems should account for the multiple written variants used to represent biomedical concepts, and allow the user to search for specific pieces of knowledge (or events) involving these concepts, e.g., protein-protein interactions. Such functionality requires access to detailed information about words used in the biomedical literature. Existing databases and ontologies often have a specific focus and are oriented towards human use. Consequently, biological knowledge is dispersed amongst many resources, which often do not attempt to account for the large and frequently changing set of variants that appear in the literature. Additionally, such resources typically do not provide information about how terms relate to each other in texts to describe events. Results: This article provides an overview of the design, construction and evaluation of a large-scale lexical and conceptual resource for the biomedical domain, the BioLexicon. The resource can be exploited by text mining tools at several levels, e.g., part-of-speech tagging, recognition of biomedical entities, and the extraction of events in which they are involved. As such, the BioLexicon must account for real usage of words in biomedical texts. In particular, the BioLexicon gathers together different types of terms from several existing data resources into a single, unified repository, and augments them with new term variants automatically extracted from biomedical literature. Extraction of events is facilitated through the inclusion of biologically pertinent verbs (around which events are typically organized) together with information about typical patterns of grammatical and semantic behaviour, which are acquired from domain-specific texts. In order to foster interoperability, the BioLexicon is modelled using the Lexical Markup Framework, an ISO standard. Conclusions: The BioLexicon contains over 2.2 M lexical entries and over 1.8 M terminological variants, as well as over 3.3 M semantic relations, including over 2 M synonymy relations. Its exploitation can benefit both application developers and users. We demonstrate some such benefits by describing integration of the resource into a number of different tools, and evaluating improvements in performance that this can bring.

This work main contribution is a text comprehension classification methodology for the detection of reading comprehension failures in educational institutions. The proposed approach relates situational model theories and latent semantic analysis from fields of psycholinguistics and natural language processing respectively. A numerical characterization of students documents using structural information, such as the usage of text connectors, and latent semantic features are used as input for traditional classification algorithms. Therefore, an automated classifier is built to determine whether a given student could or not comprehend the information in the given stimulus documents.

The AGM combines the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) with Text Clustering (TC) to measure the content quality of English text. In the AGM, LSA represents the meaning of words as vectors in semantic space using statistical analysis technique applied to large corpus, and TC is applied to classify the texts in the corpus into different categories. By comparing the similarity of a text with reference texts which are belong to the same cluster on basis of semantic content, our model can grade the text in the same cluster. In addition, the AGM can judge the to-be-graded text whether related to the given subject. Our experiments show that the AGM is competent in grading the content of texts.

16023;"Enriching a biomedical event corpus with meta-knowledge annotation";0;"Thompson, P. and Nawaz, R. and McNaught, J. and Ananiadou, S.";"Background: Biomedical papers contain rich information about entities, facts and events of biological relevance. To discover these automatically, we use text mining techniques, which rely on annotated corpora for training. In order to extract protein-protein interactions, genotype-phenotype/gene-disease associations, etc., we rely on event corpora that are annotated with classified, structured representations of important facts and findings contained within text. These provide an important resource for the training of domain-specific information extraction (IE) systems, to facilitate semantic-based searching of documents. Correct interpretation of these events is not possible without additional information, e.g., does an event describe a fact, a hypothesis, an experimental result or an analysis of results? How confident is the author about the validity of her analyses? These and other types of information, which we collectively term meta-knowledge, can be derived from the context of the event. Results: We have designed an annotation scheme for meta-knowledge enrichment of biomedical event corpora. The scheme is multi-dimensional, in that each event is annotated for 5 different aspects of meta-knowledge that can be derived from the textual context of the event. Textual clues used to determine the values are also annotated. The scheme is intended to be general enough to allow integration with different types of bio-event annotation, whilst being detailed enough to capture important subtleties in the nature of the meta-knowledge expressed in the text. We report here on both the main features of the annotation scheme, as well as its application to the GENIA event corpus (1000 abstracts with 36,858 events). High levels of inter-annotator agreement have been achieved, falling in the range of 0.84-0.93 Kappa. Conclusion: By augmenting event annotations with meta-knowledge, more sophisticated IE systems can be trained, which allow interpretative information to be specified as part of the search criteria. This can assist in a number of important tasks, e.g., finding new experimental knowledge to facilitate database curation, enabling textual inference to detect entailments and contradictions, etc. To our knowledge, our scheme is unique within the field with regards to the diversity of meta-knowledge aspects annotated for each event.

This paper presents a new method of hierarchical text clustering based on combination of latent semantic analysis (LSA) and hierarchical GSOM, which is called LSA-HGSOM method. The text clustering result using traditional methods can not show hierarchical structure. However, the hierarchical structure is very important in text clustering. The LSA-HGSOM method can automatically achieve hierarchical text clustering, and establishes vector space model (VSM) of term weight by using the theory of LSA, then semantic relation is included in the vector space model. Both theory analysis and experimental results confirm that LSA-HGSOM method decreases the number of vector, and enhances the efficiency and precision of text clustering.

This paper presents a novel unsupervised method for discovering intra-sentence level discourse relations for eliminating polarity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cue-phrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods not only effectively recognized the defined discourse relations but also achieved significant improvement by integrating discourse information in sentence-level polarity classification.

16030;"Improving MeSH classification of biomedical articles using citation contexts";0;"Aljaber, B.a  and Martinez, D.a  b  and Stokes, N.c  and Bailey, J.a  b ";"Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are used to index the majority of databases generated by the National Library of Medicine. Essentially, MeSH terms are designed to make information, such as scientific articles, more retrievable and assessable to users of systems such as PubMed. This paper proposes a novel method for automating the assignment of biomedical publications with MeSH terms that takes advantage of citation references to these publications. Our findings show that analysing the citation references that point to a document can provide a useful source of terms that are not present in the document. The use of these citation contexts, as they are known, can thus help to provide a richer document feature representation, which in turn can help improve text mining and information retrieval applications, in our case MeSH term classification. In this paper, we also explore new methods of selecting and utilising citation contexts. In particular, we assess the effect of weighting the importance of citation terms (found in the citation contexts) according to two aspects: (i) the section of the paper they appear in and (ii) their distance to the citation marker.We conduct intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of citation term quality. For the intrinsic evaluation, we rely on the UMLS Metathesaurus conceptual database to explore the semantic characteristics of the mined citation terms. We also analyse the "" informativeness"" of these terms using a class-entropy measure. For the extrinsic evaluation, we run a series of automatic document classification experiments over MeSH terms.

16037;"Subjectivity classification and analysis of the ASRS corpus";0;"Switzer, J.a  and Khan, L.a  and Muhaya, F.B.b ";"Semantic analysis of corpora containing heavy usage of jargon words and phrases introduces problems not commonly addressed by Natural Language Processing methods. Modern semantic analysis relies on data from unedited websites or other expertly written sources, which lack similar usage of jargon words and phrases. This paper presents a system of semi-supervised lexicon learning algorithms that collate several manually labeled and clustered data sources, such as thesauri. In addition, this paper demonstrates an improvement in performance of these subjectivity classifiers by applying a boosting method. This paper presents a method of automatic Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) shaping factor classification based on the most relevant words from a subjectivity lexicon.

We describe how - by incorporating new techniques - we increase both speed and robustness of deep analysis, specifically on long sentences where deep parsing often failed in former approaches. With the current open source HPSG (Head-driven phrase structure grammar) for English (ERG), we obtain deep parses for more than 85% of the sentences in the 1.5 million sentences corpus, while the former approaches achieved only approx. 65% coverage. The resulting sentence-wise semantic representations are used in the Scientists Workbench, a platform demonstrating the use and benefit of natural language processing (NLP) to support scientists or other knowledge workers in fast and better access to digital document content. With the generated NLP annotations, we are able to implement important, novel applications such as robust semantic search, citation classification, and (in the future) question answering and definition exploration.

Although LDA has been mostly used as a strictly lexicalized approach, it can be effectively applicable to a much richer set of linguistic structures. A novel application of LDA is here presented that acquires suitable grammatical generalizations for semantic tasks tightly dependent on NL syntax. We show how the resulting topics represent suitable generalizations over syntactic structures and lexical information as well. The evaluation on two different classification tasks, such as predicate recognition and question classification, shows that state of the art results are obtained.

16046;"Topic discovery based on dual em merging";0;"Zeng, J.a  and Duan, J.b  and Wu, C.a ";"Facing the enormous text on the Internet, automatic topic discovery out of large text corpus becomes an important task for advanced intelligence information analysis, such as opinion recognition, Web user interest analysis, etc. Although many topic mining methods have shown great success in dealing with topic-based analysis tasks, it is desired to discover meaningful topic descriptions for informatics analysis. To avoid words with different granularity to explain a topic, a mechanism for separating text corpus into two subsets with equal semantic topics is proposed. EM algorithm is employed to infer topics models for the subsets. Then a merging process is devised to generate topic descriptions based on the output of EM. Experiments on standard AP text corpus shows that the proposed topic discovery method can achieve better perplexity, which means better ability in predicting topics. Furthermore, a test of topics extraction on a collection of news documents about recent Expo 2010 Shanghai China shows that the description key words in topics are more meaningful and reasonable than that of tradition topic mining method.

This information includes statistical data about words in documents, information about aspects in which this words appears, classification, clustering, etc. To meet these expectations we propose using methods for searching for hidden patterns in multivariable data.

Traditional text clustering approaches are based on vector space model, in which a document is represented as a vector using term frequency based weighting scheme. The main disadvantage of this model is that it cannot fully exploit semantic correlations between social annotations and document contents because term frequency based weighting scheme only captures the number of occurrences of terms in the document. However, social annotation of web pages implicates fundamental and valuable semantic information thus can be fully utilized to improve information retrieval system. In this paper, we investigate and evaluate several extended vector space models which can combine social annotation and web page text. In particular, we propose a novel vector space model by computing the semantic correlations between social annotations and web page words. Comparing with other vector space models, our experiments show that using semantic correlations between social tags and web page words improves the clustering accuracy with RI score increase of 4% âˆ¼ 7%.

However, due to costly edit and maintenance, WordNets capability of keeping up with the emergence of new concepts is poor compared with on-line encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. To keep WordNet current with folk wisdom, we propose a method to enhance WordNet automatically by merging Wikipedia entities into WordNet, and construct an enriched ontology, named as WorkiNet. WorkiNet keeps the desirable structure of WordNet. At the same time, it captures abundant information from Wikipedia. We also propose a learning approach which is able to generate a tailor-made semantic concept collection for a given document collection. The learning process takes the characteristics of the given document collection into consideration and the semantic concepts in the tailor-made collection can be used as new features for document representation. The experimental results show that the adaptively generated feature space can outperform a static one significantly in text mining tasks, and WorkiNet dominates WordNet most of the time due to its high coverage.

16055;"Probabilistic topic models with biased propagation on heterogeneous information networks";0;"Deng, H. and Han, J. and Zhao, B. and Yu, Y. and Lin, C.X.";"With the development of Web applications, textual documents are not only getting richer, but also ubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in various ways, which brings about text-rich heterogeneous information networks. Topic models have been proposed and shown to be useful for document analysis, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics of the network. However, most of topic models only consider the textual information while ignore the network structures or can merely integrate with homogeneous networks. None of them can handle heterogeneous information network well. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model with biased propagation (TMBP) algorithm to directly incorporate heterogeneous information network with topic modeling in a unified way. The underlying intuition is that multi-typed objects should be treated differently along with their inherent textual information and the rich semantics of the heterogeneous information network. A simple and unbiased topic propagation across such a heterogeneous network does not make much sense. Consequently, we investigate and develop two biased propagation frameworks, the biased random walk framework and the biased regularization framework, for the TMBP algorithm from different perspectives, which can discover latent topics and identify clusters of multi-typed objects simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach and compare to the state-of-the-art techniques on several datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in our proposed approach is consistent and promising.

16065;"An extended supervised term weighting method for text categorization";0;"Wei, B.a  and Feng, B.a  and He, F.b  and Fu, X.c ";"When Support Vector Machines (SVM) are exploited for automatic text categorization, text representation and term weighting have a significant impact on the performance of text classification. Conventional supervised weighting methods only focus on the frequency characteristics of feature terms, without consideration of semantic characteristics of them. Inspired by supervised weighting method, semantic distance between terms and categories is introduced into term weights calculation. The first step is modeling each category with two vectors of feature terms, which are called category core terms, and acquiring these terms by machine learning methods. Second, the semantic distance between feature terms and category core terms is calculated based on semantic database. Third, the global weight factor is replaced by the sematic distance to calculate the weight of every term. Based on the standard benchmark Reuters-21578, this kind of term weighting schemas can generally produce satisfied results of classification using SVMlight as classifier with default parameters.

16068;"A statistical approach for automatic text summarization by extraction";0;"Chandra, M.a  and Gupta, V.b  and Paul, S.K.b ";"Automatic Document Summarization is a highly interdisciplinary research area related with computer science as well as cognitive psychology. This Summarization is to compress an original document into a summarized version by extracting almost all of the essential concepts with text mining techniques. This research focuses on developing a statistical automatic text summarization approach, K-mixture probabilistic model, to enhancing the quality of summaries. KSRS employs the K-mixture probabilistic model to establish term weights in a statistical sense, and further identifies the term relationships to derive the semantic relationship significance (SRS) of nouns. Sentences are ranked and extracted based on their semantic relationship significance values. The objective of this research is thus to propose a statistical approach to text summarization. We propose a K-mixture semantic relationship significance (KSRS) approach to enhancing the quality of document summary results. The K-mixture probabilistic model is used to determine the term weights. Term relationships are then investigated to develop the semantic relationship of nouns that manifests sentence semantics. Sentences with significant semantic relationship, nouns are extracted to form the summary accordingly.

Text clustering or shortly clustering is about discovering semantically related groups in an unstructured collection of documents. Clustering has been very popular for a long time because it provides unique ways of digesting and generalizing large amounts of information. One of the issues of clustering is to extract proper feature (concept) of a problem domain. The existing clustering technology mainly focuses on term weight calculation. To achieve more accurate document clustering, more informative features including concept weight are important. Feature Selection is important for clustering process because some of the irrelevant or redundant feature may misguide the clustering results. To counteract this issue, the proposed system presents the concept weight for text clustering system developed based on a k-means algorithm in accordance with the principles of ontology so that the important of words of a cluster can be identified by the weight values.

16071;"Literature-related discovery: Potential treatments and preventatives for SARS";0;"Kostoff, R.N.";"Literature-related discovery (LRD) is the linking of two or more previously disjoint concepts in order to produce novel, interesting, plausible, and intelligible connections (i.e., potential discovery). LRD has been used to identify potential treatments or preventative actions for challenging medical problems, among myriad other applications. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first pandemic of the 21st century. SARS was eventually controlled through increased hygienic measures (e.g., face mask protection, frequent hand washing, living quarter disinfection), travel restrictions, and quarantine. According to recent reviews of SARS, none of the drugs that were used during the pandemic worked. For the present paper, SARS was selected as the first application of LRD to an infectious disease. The main goal of this research was to identify non-drug non-surgical treatments that would 1) prevent the occurrence, or 2) reduce the progression rate, or 3) stop/reverse the progression of SARS. The MeSH taxonomy of Medline was used to restrict potential discoveries to selected semantic classes, and to identify potential discoveries efficiently. To enhance the volume of potential discovery, databases were used in addition to Medline. These included the Science Citation Index (SCI) and, in contrast to previous work, a full text database. Because of the richness of the full text, surgical queries were developed that targeted the exact types of potential discovery of interest while eliminating clutter more efficiently.

However, most of existing indexing techniques have difficulties to address this problem due to special properties of a document query, e.g. high dimensionality, sparse representation and semantic issue. Towards addressing this problem, we propose a two-level retrieval solution based on a document decomposition idea. A document is decomposed to a compact vector and a few document specific keywords by a dimension reduction approach. The compact vector embodies the major semantics of a document, and the document specific keywords complement the discriminative power lost in dimension reduction process. We adopt locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to index the compact vectors, which guarantees to quickly find a set of related documents according to the vector of a query document. Then we re-rank documents in this set by their document specific keywords. In experiments, we obtained promising results on various datasets in terms of both accuracy and performance.

16073;"Developing position structure-based framework for chinese entity relation extraction";0;"Zhang, P.a  and Li, W.b  and Hou, Y.c  and Song, D.a ";"Relation extraction is the task of finding semantic relations between two entities in text, and is often cast as a classification problem. In contrast to the significant achievements on English language, research progress in Chinese relation extraction is relatively limited. In this article, we present a novel Chinese relation extraction framework, which is mainly based on a 9-position structure. The design of this proposed structure is motivated by the fact that there are some obvious connections between relation types/subtypes and position structures of two entities. The 9-position structure can be captured with less effort than applying deep natural language processing, and is effective to relieve the class imbalance problem which often hurts the classification performance. In our framework, all involved features do not require Chinese word segmentation, which has long been limiting the performance of Chinese language processing. We also utilize some correction and inference mechanisms to further improve the classified results. Experiments on the ACE 2005 Chinese data set show that the 9-position structure feature can provide strong support for Chinese relation extraction. As well as this, other strategies are also effective to further improve the performance.

16074;"SVM based extraction of spatial relations in text";0;"Zhang, X. and Zhang, C. and Du, C. and Zhu, S.";"Natural language text describes the nature of peoples internal representation of space. It is investigated that 80% of unstructured text has location expressions e.g. place names and spatial relations. In the past few years, text has become a most important geospatial data resource as well as survey, map, satellite images and GPS. The most previous research focused on the recognition of place names in text and its integration with map services. Spatial relations play an important role in the fields of spatial data modelling, spatial query, spatial analysis, spatial reasoning and map generalization. Spatial relations in text are described in natural language with qualitative spatial expressions including place names, spatial terms, prepositions, verbs and so on. And these expressions are combined with certain syntactic patterns to represent their semantic functions. An instance of spatial relation in text can be simply formalized as (C1, P1, C2, P2, C3), where P1 and P2 are place names, and C1, C2 and C3 are the context. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a pattern recognition method popularly used in information extraction from text. This paper investigates the extraction of spatial relations based on SVM model which can implement the recognition of spatial expressions and their classification synchronously. For the SVM model, a set of feature vectors are specified, such as lexical tokens, spatial terms, syntactic structures and geographical feature types of place names, and a multi-label classifier is presented to solve the multi-classification problem. Finally, an experimental evaluation is explored in a Chinese annotation corpus. This study proves that spatial terms are important indicators for identification of spatial relations in text. However, there is serious ambiguity of their classification. Therefore, integration of much more context information could potentially improve the performance of extraction of spatial relations in text.

We employ near duplicate detection and automatic classification techniques that can be used to create coherent groups of documents. Since a group characterizes a syntactic or a semantic theme all the documents in a group can be reviewed together. This leads to a faster and more consistent review of documents. Our experimental results on the publicly available Enron email corpus show that we can achieve high precision and recall in identifying the syntactic and semantic groups. We also conduct a user study that demonstrates 80% reduction in the review time and improved consistency in the review results, leading to better service quality.

The existing literature typically incorporates the impact of product reviews on sales based on numeric variables representing the valence and volume of reviews. In this paper, we posit that the information embedded in product reviews cannot be captured by a single scalar value. Rather, we argue that product reviews are multifaceted, and hence the textual content of product reviews is an important determinant of consumers choices, over and above the valence and volume of reviews. To demonstrate this, we use text mining to incorporate review text in a consumer choice model by decomposing textual reviews into segments describing different product features. We estimate our model based on a unique data set from Amazon containing sales data and consumer review data for two different groups of products (digital cameras and camcorders) over a 15-month period. We alleviate the problems of data sparsity and of omitted variables by providing two experimental techniques: clustering rare textual opinions based on pointwise mutual information and using externally imposed review semantics. This paper demonstrates how textual data can be used to learn consumers relative preferences for different product features and also how text can be used for predictive modeling of future changes in sales.

Based on this scenario, fast clustering techniques for online stage are proposed including how to project documents onto output layers in SOM, fast similarity computation method and the scheme of Incremental clustering technology for real-time processing, We tested the system using different datasets, the practical performance demonstrate that our approach has been shown to be much superior in clustering efficiency whereas the clustering quality are comparable to traditional methods.

16087;"Text summarization method applying vocabulary combination into sentence extraction";0;"Yongqing, W.a  and Peipei, J.b  and Mingying, X.b ";"Semantic loss between feature words is identified as the main reason for the low quality of text summary, however, the root reason for this phenomenon is the low segmentation accuracy of lexical analysis system and the orthogonal assumptions existed in text representation model. To solve this issue, we proposed an integrated with semantic method that is able to generate high quality text summary in this paper. This method formulates the amendment rules which are used to the sentences formed after partition process of the words to regulate the vocabulary combination, according to the part of speech, making the words in the same sentence semantically related to each other can establish their appropriate links.

Different from standard dictionaries and lexical databases, semantic databases provide a rich hierarchy of semantic relations in ontological structures. Our disambiguation approach decides on the implied sense by computing concept similarity measures as a function of semantic relations defined in ontological graph representation of concepts. Our similarity measures also utilize Wikipedia descriptions of concepts. We performed a preliminary experimental evaluation, measuring disambiguation success rate and its correlation with input text content. The results show that our method outperforms well-known disambiguation methods.

In the meantime, the area of text processing developed in many different directions whereby the original goals were often forgotten. Funny enough, it seems, in several decades of computerized processing of textual data, the solution to the text understanding problem didnt evolve much compared to some other, easier and often more profitable problems to deal with (such as information retrieval/search, machine translation or information extraction). In this paper we touch various aspects of text processing along several dimensions: (a) how we represent the textual data, (b) what kind of algorithms and techniques we use, and (c) what kind of problems we solve on the top of text. Finally, it is interesting to observe various research communities dealing with textual data in different ways. Most of them are still rather fragmented and dont learn enough from each other - many of the ideas developed within one community dont cross borders of that community for too long.

However, many new technologies have been made available since the introduction of TF-IDF. This paper proposes a new method for recommending news items based on TF-IDF and a domain ontology. It is demonstrated that adapting TF-IDF with the semantics of a domain ontology, resulting in Concept Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (CF-IDF), yields better results than using the original TF-IDF method. CF-IDF is built and tested in Athena, a recommender extension to the Hermes news personalization framework. Athena employs a user profile to store concepts or terms found in news items browsed by the user. The framework recommends new articles to the user using a traditional TF-IDF recommender and the CF-IDF recommender. A statistical evaluation of both methods shows that the use of an ontology significantly improves the performance of a traditional recommender.

16096;"Sentiment classification of documents based on latent semantic analysis";0;"Wang, L.a  and Wan, Y.b ";"Sentiment classification has attracted increasing interest from natural language processing. The goal of sentiment classification is to automatically identify whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion on a topic of interest. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) has been shown to be extremely useful in information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new method, based on LSA and support vector machine (SVM) to improve the sentiment classification performance. This method takes the advantage of both LSA and SVM. During the training process, SVM makes use of its excellent classification ability to conduct the sentiment classification first. To show that our method is feasible and effective, we designed two experiments and the experimental result shows that the introduction of SVM outperforms the other experiment in precision of the polarity analysis.

Firstly, three tasks are identified after analyzing on ontology auto-extension. Secondly, a new binary tree (BT) is constructed based on the ontology taxonomy, and then it is used as the training and learning strategy of support vector machine (SVM) classifier. And the full strategy is regarded as Onto-BT-SVM model. The main advantage of this strategy is that the semantic of ontology is made full use of. Finally, Different multi-class classification strategies are compared to verify their impacts on classification effects.

In this paper we describe an approach to enhance the extraction of semantic contents from unstructured textual documents, in particular considering Wikipedia articles and focusing on event mining. Starting from the deep parsing of a set of English Wikipedia articles, we produce a semantic annotation compliant with the Knowledge Annotation Format (KAF). We extract events from the KAF semantic annotation and then we structure each event as a set of RDF triples linked to both DBpedia and WordNet. We point out examples of automatically mined events, providing some general evaluation of how our approach may discover new events and link them to existing contents.

To address the problem, we propose a semantically-based navigation application that is based on the theories and techniques of link mining, semantic relatedness analysis and text summarization. Our goal is to develop an application that assists users in efficiently finding the related subtopics for a seed query and then quickly checking the content of articles. We establish a topic network by analyzing the internal links of Wikipedia and applying the Normalized Google Distance algorithm in order to quantify the strength of the semantic relationships between articles via key terms. To help users explore and read topic-related articles, we propose a SNA-based summarization approach to summarize articles. To visualize the topic network more efficiently, we develop a semantically-based WikiMap to help users navigate Wikipedia effectively.

16111;"Hierarchical FCA-based conceptual model of text documents used in information retrieval system";0;"Butka, P.a  and Pocsova, J.b ";"Searching for relevant documents in large sets of documents is one of the key tasks in the areas of semantic web and knowledge technologies. This paper deals with analysis and design of improvement for information retrieval (IR) using specific conceptual model automatically created from semantically non-annotated set of text documents. This conceptual model combines locally applied Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and agglomerative clustering of particular models into one structure, which is suitable to support information retrieval process and can be combined with standard full-text search. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is one of the approaches which can be applied in process of conceptual modeling in domain of text documents. Extension of classic FCA (binary table data) is one-sided fuzzy version that works with real values in the object-attribute table (document-term matrix in case of vector representation of text documents). In our approach, starting set of documents is decomposed to smaller sets of similar documents with the use of some partitional clustering algorithm.

16113;"Identifying and tracking online financial services through web mining and latent semantic indexing";0;"Bernard, K. and Cassidy, A. and Clark, M. and Liu, K. and Lobaton, K. and McNeill, D. and Brown, D.";"As Internet usage has heavily increased within recent years, money launderers have started to take advantage of Online Financial Transaction (OFT) services to facilitate their money laundering activities. However, law enforcement has struggled to understand and detect OFT services that criminals use for money laundering. To assist law enforcement in its efforts to identify and monitor OFT services, we have designed the Online Financial Transaction Services Identification Tool (OFTSIT), which crawls the Internet and determines the probability that they are OFT services. OFTSIT analyzes a websites content and extracts textual features using latent semantic indexing (LSI). LSI is a text mining approach that can extract a small number (< 10) of features from more than 40,000 possible words on a website. OFTSIT inputs the LSI discovered features into a generalized linear model to produce the probability that a website is an OFT service. Testing showed that OFTSIT outperforms current method of manual searching. This paper describes the system architecture, algorithms employed to classify OFT services from other websites, and performance testing to demonstrate OFTSITs operational relevance.

16115;"Improving self-organising information maps as navigational tools: A semantic approach";0;"Lin, Y.-L. and Brusilovsky, P. and He, D.";"Purpose - The goal of the research is to explore whether the use of higher-level semantic features can help us to build better self-organising map (SOM) representation as measured from a human-centred perspective. The authors also explore an automatic evaluation method that utilises human expert knowledge encapsulated in the structure of traditional textbooks to determine map representation quality. Design/methodology/approach - Two types of document representations involving semantic features have been explored - i.e. using only one individual semantic feature, and mixing a semantic feature with keywords. Experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of semantic representation quality on the map. The experiments were performed on data collections from a single book corpus and a multiple book corpus. Findings - Combining keywords with certain semantic features achieves significant improvement of representation quality over the keywords-only approach in a relatively homogeneous single book corpus. Changing the ratios in combining different features also affects the performance. While semantic mixtures can work well in a single book corpus, they lose their advantages over keywords in the multiple book corpus. This raises a concern about whether the semantic representations in the multiple book corpus are homogeneous and coherent enough for applying semantic features. The terminology issue among textbooks affects the ability of the SOM to generate a high quality map for heterogeneous collections. Originality/value - The authors explored the use of higher-level document representation features for the development of better quality SOM. In addition the authors have piloted a specific method for evaluating the SOM quality based on the organisation of information content in the map.

One important task of text mining in biomedical literature is gene mention normalization which recognizes the biomedical entities in biomedical texts and maps each gene mention discussed in the text to unique organic database identifiers. In this work, we employ an information retrieval based method which extracts gene mentions semantic profile from PubMed abstracts for gene mention disambiguation. This disambiguation method focuses on generating a more comprehensive representation of gene mention rather than the organic clues such as gene ontology which has fewer co-occurrences with the gene mention. Furthermore, we use an existing biomedical resource as another disambiguation method. Then we extract features from gene mention detection systems outcome to build a false positive filter according to Wikipedias retrieved documents.

16126;"Unsupervised feature weighting based on local feature relatedness";0;"Yun, J. and Jing, L. and Yu, J. and Huang, H.";"Feature weighting plays an important role in text clustering. Traditional feature weighting is determined by the syntactic relationship between feature and document (e.g. TF-IDF). In this paper, a semantically enriched feature weighting approach is proposed by introducing the semantic relationship between feature and document, which is implemented by taking account of the local feature relatedness - the relatedness between feature and its contextual features within each individual document. Feature relatedness is measured by two methods, document collection-based implicit relatedness measure and Wikipedia link-based explicit relatedness measure. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the new feature weighting approach surpasses traditional syntactic feature weighting. Moreover, clustering quality can be further improved by linearly combining the syntactic and semantic factors. The new feature weighting approach is also compared with two existing feature relatedness-based approaches which consider the global feature relatedness (feature relatedness in the entire feature space) and the inter-document feature relatedness (feature relatedness between different documents) respectively. In the experiments, the new feature weighting approach outperforms these two related work in clustering quality and costs much less computational complexity.

Reuse of mutation impact annotations requires grounding mutations to the correct positions on sequences extracted from protein databases as a critical step. This paper presents a generic method for grounding textual mentions of mutation entities to protein sequences, that is based on an OWL-DL ontology driven workflow that integrates text and sequence information in a semantically consistent way. Mutation mentions mined from texts are iteratively mapped onto candidate proteins, and an ontology mining algorithm facilitates their correct grounding to a protein sequence. Using a gold standard corpus of full text articles and corresponding protein sequences we show the proposed method is promising compared to existing approaches.

Our goals in this research were to identify facilitation strategies that encourage productive discussion, and to explore text mining techniques that can help discover meaningful patterns in the discussions more efficiently at scale. Based on a close reading of selected discussion threads from online undergraduate science classes, we observed a variety of facilitation strategies associated with discussion quality. These observations informed our selection of a larger dataset of discussion threads to analyze via text mining techniques. Using latent semantic analysis to produce topic models of the content of the discussions, we constructed visualizations of the topical and temporal development of those discussions among students and faculty. These visualizations revealed patterns that appeared to correspond with specific facilitation styles and with the extent to which discussions remained focused on particular topics. From a case study focusing on six of these discussions, we documented distinct patterns in the types of facilitation strategies employed and the character of the discussions that followed.

16134;"Affiliation disambiguation for constructing semantic digital libraries";0;"Jiang, Y.a  and Zheng, H.-T.a  and Wang, X.a  and Lu, B.b  and Wu, K.b ";"With increasing digital information availability, semantic web technologies have been employed to construct semantic digital libraries in order to ease information comprehension. The use of semantic web enables users to search or visualize resources in a semantic fashion. Semantic web generation is a key process in semantic digital library construction, which converts metadata of digital resources into semantic web data. Many text mining technologies, such as keyword extraction and clustering, have been proposed to generate semantic web data. However, one important type of metadata in publications, called affiliation, is hard to convert into semantic web data precisely because different authors, who have the same affiliation, often express the affiliation in different ways. To address this issue, this paper proposes a clustering method based on normalized compression distance for the purpose of affiliation disambiguation. The experimental results show that our method is able to identify different affiliations that denote the same institutes. The clustering results outperform the well-known k-means clustering method in terms of average precision, F-measure, entropy, and purity.

16136;"Exploring subdomain variation in biomedical language";0;"Lippincott, T. and SÃ©aghdha, D.T. and Korhonen, A.";"Background: Applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to biomedical texts have generated significant interest in recent years. In this paper we identify and investigate the phenomenon of linguistic subdomain variation within the biomedical domain, i.e., the extent to which different subject areas of biomedicine are characterised by different linguistic behaviour. While variation at a coarser domain level such as between newswire and biomedical text is well-studied and known to affect the portability of NLP systems, we are the first to conduct an extensive investigation into more fine-grained levels of variation.Results: Using the large OpenPMC text corpus, which spans the many subdomains of biomedicine, we investigate variation across a number of lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse-related dimensions. These dimensions are chosen for their relevance to the performance of NLP systems. We use clustering techniques to analyse commonalities and distinctions among the subdomains.Conclusions: We find that while patterns of inter-subdomain variation differ somewhat from one feature set to another, robust clusters can be identified that correspond to intuitive distinctions such as that between clinical and laboratory subjects. In particular, subdomains relating to genetics and molecular biology, which are the most common sources of material for training and evaluating biomedical NLP tools, are not representative of all biomedical subdomains. We conclude that an awareness of subdomain variation is important when considering the practical use of language processing applications by biomedical researchers.

16139;"Fuzzy document clustering using weighted conceptual model";0;"Song, S. and Guo, Z. and Chen, P.";"Document clustering techniques mostly rely on single term analysis which can not reveal the potential semantic relationship between terms. To better capture the semantic subject of documents, this study proposes weighted conceptual model for document presentation.

The semantic similarity between two documents is calculated by centroid concepts and peripheral concepts respectively.

These methods ignore semantic information of text documents, and semantic information enhanced methods distinguish between text documents poorly because extended vectors with semantic similar terms aggravate the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a similarity measurement, which is based on TF-IDF method, and analyzes similarity between important terms in text documents. This approach uses NLP technology to pre-process text, and uses TF-IDF method to filter those key terms that have higher TF-IDF value than other common terms. With the proposed data structure TSWT (Term Similarity Weight Tree) and the definition of semantic similarity, this paper resolves the semantic information of those key terms to compute similarities between text documents.

16147;"DVD: A model for event diversified versions discovery";0;"Kong, L.a  and Yan, R.b  and He, Y.b  and Zhang, Y.a  and Zhang, Z.c  and Fu, L.c ";"With the development of the techniques of Event Detection and Tracking, it is feasible to gather text information from many sources and structure it into events which are constructed online automatically and updated temporally. There are always diversified versions to describe an event and users usually are eager to know all the versions. With the huge quantity of documents, it is almost impossible for users to read all of them. In this paper, we formally define the problem of event diversified versions discovery. We introduce a novel and principled model (called DVD) for discovering diversified versions for events. Unlike traditional clustering methods, we apply an iterative algorithm on a bipartite graph integrating co-occurrence and semantics to select the popular words and filter them to reduce the tight correlation between documents in a specific event. Hybrid link structures between words are utilized to find the hierarchical relationships. We employ a web communities discovery algorithm to construct virtual-documents which consist of a bag of words indicating one of the diversified versions. Under Rocchio Classification framework, we can classify the documents to diversified versions. With our novel evaluation method, empirical experiments on two real datasets show that DVD is effective and outperforms various related algorithms, including classic K-means and LDA.

16151;"Concept-based information retrieval using explicit semantic analysis";0;"Egozi, O.a  and Markovitch, S.a  and Gabrilovich, E.b ";"Information retrieval systems traditionally rely on textual keywords to index and retrieve documents. Keyword-based retrieval may return inaccurate and incomplete results when different keywords are used to describe the same concept in the documents and in the queries. Furthermore, the relationship between these related keywords may be semantic rather than syntactic, and capturing it thus requires access to comprehensive human world knowledge. Concept-based retrieval methods have attempted to tackle these difficulties by using manually built thesauri, by relying on term cooccurrence data, or by extracting latent word relationships and concepts from a corpus. In this article we introduce a new concept-based retrieval approach based on Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a recently proposed method that augments keywordbased text representation with concept-based features, automatically extracted from massive human knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia. Our approach generates new text features automatically, and we have found that high-quality feature selection becomes crucial in this setting to make the retrieval more focused. However, due to the lack of labeled data, traditional feature selection methods cannot be used, hence we propose new methods that use self-generated labeled training data. The resulting system is evaluated on several TREC datasets, showing superior performance over previous state-of-the-art results.

16152;"Ontology-based customer preference modeling for concept generation";0;"Cao, D.a  c  and Li, Z.b  and Ramani, K.c ";"Customers often present certain preferences relative to the same product, such as function, shape, color, and cost. The ideas in the mind of the customer can be represented by higher level concepts. However, the actual shape, color, and cost embodied in the product can only be viewed as lower-level features. In this paper, a model of preference elicitation from customers is proposed to bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level concepts. First, the attributes of customer preferences are classified using preference taxonomies that we develop. These taxonomies are represented using unstructured documents that are directly collected from customer descriptions. Second, the documents or catalogs of design requirements, containing some textual descriptions and survey reports, are then normalized by using an ontology-based semantic representation. Some semantic rules are developed to describe the low-level features of customer preferences to build an ontological knowledge base. Third, customer preferences are mapped to domain ontologies for driving high-level concept generation. A customer preference modeling framework is developed to construct a vector space model to measure the similarity between two preference concept ontologies. Finally, an empirical study is implemented, and five different customer groups are surveyed about the cell phone preferences. The query results are analyzed to deeply understand the validity of concept generation from the customer preferences. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

16155;"Semantic multi-grain mixture topic model for text analysis";0;"Zeng, J.a  and Duan, J.b  and Wang, W.a  and Wu, C.a ";"Granular topic extraction and modeling are fundament tasks in text analysis. Hierarchical topic clustering algorithms and hierarchical topic models are usually employed for these purposes. However, it is difficult to make a clear distinguish between each pair of hierarchical topics from the semantic granularity point of view. STG (semantic topic granularity) is proposed to indicate the details degree of topic description, and aim at providing discrimination for topics from semantic aspect. A new model, mgMTM (multi-grain mixture topic model) based on STG is then proposed to model grain topics. DCT (discrete cosine transform) is employed to provide a mechanism for computing STG, extracting grain topics and learning mgMTM. Experiments on real world datasets show that the proposed model has lower perplexity score than that of LDA model and thus has better generalization performance in describing text. Experiments also show that the description of the extracted grain topics can be well explained with respect to a dataset including topics about recent global financial crisis. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

16156;"Normalization of semantic based web search engines using page rank algorithm and hypergraph based clustering";0;"Archana, G. and Muruganantham, B. and Jayapradha, J.";"In recent years, with the massive growth of web, there is an explosion of information accessible to internet users. The search logic usually tries to recover this information by exploiting many text-matching techniques. Also, traditional search engines do not have the necessary infrastructure for exploiting relation-based information that belongs to the semantic annotations for a web page. In the semantic web, each page possesses semantic metadata that record additional details concerning the web page itself. Annotations are based on classes of concepts and relations among them. We propose that relations among concepts embedded into semantic annotations can be effectively exploited to define a ranking strategy for semantic based web search engines. This approach relies on the knowledge of the user query, the underlying ontology, the hypergraph based clustering, and the web pages to be ranked. Thus, it allows us to effectively manage the search space and to reduce the complexity associated with the ranking task.

16159;"SemRank: Ranking refinement strategy by using the semantic intensity";0;"Aslam, N.a  and Ullah, I.a  b  and Loo, J.a  and Ullah, R.c  and Loomes, M.a ";"The ubiquity of the multimedia has raised a need for the system that can store, manage, structured the multimedia data in such a way that it can be retrieved intelligently. One of the current issues in media management or data mining research is ranking of retrieved documents. Ranking is one of the provocative problems for information retrieval systems. Given a user query comes up with the millions of relevant results but if the ranking function cannot rank it according to the relevancy than all results are just obsolete. However, the current ranking techniques are in the level of keyword matching. The ranking among the results is usually done by using the term frequency. This paper is concerned with ranking the document relying merely on the rich semantic inside the document instead of the contents. Our proposed ranking refinement strategy known as SemRank, rank the document based on the semantic intensity. Our approach has been applied on the open benchmark LabelMe dataset and compared against one of the well known ranking model i.e. Vector Space Model (VSM). The experimental results depicts that our approach has achieved significant improvement in retrieval performance over the state of the art ranking methods.

16160;"Cross lingual text classification by mining multilingual topics from Wikipedia";0;"Ni, X.a  and Sun, J.-T.a  and Hu, J.b  and Chen, Z.a ";"This paper investigates how to effectively do cross lingual text classification by leveraging a large scale and multilingual knowledge base, Wikipedia. Based on the observation that each Wikipedia concept is described by documents of different languages, we adapt existing topic modeling algorithms for mining multilingual topics from this knowledge base. The extracted topics have multiple types of representations, with each type corresponding to one language. In this work, we regard such topics extracted from Wikipedia documents as universal-topics, since each topic corresponds with same semantic information of different languages. Thus new documents of different languages can be represented in a space using a group of universal-topics. We use these universal-topics to do cross lingual text classification. Given the training data labeled for one language, we can train a text classifier to classify the documents of another language by mapping all documents of both languages into the universal-topic space. This approach does not require any additional linguistic resources, like bilingual dictionaries, machine translation tools, or labeling data for the target language. The evaluation results indicate that our topic modeling approach is effective for building cross lingual text classifier.

To make use of the knowledge formalization continuum, the agile use of knowledge representations within a knowledge engineering project is proposed, as well as transitions between the different representations, when required.

16165;"Automatic keyword extraction from documents based on multiple content-based measures";0;"Yue, K.a  b  and Liu, W.-Y.a  b  and Zhou, L.-P.a  b ";"Automatic keyword extraction has attracted much attention due to the many applications in information retrieval, text mining, information processing, etc. To extract desired keywords from documents automatically, other than lexical relations among words or sentences, the content-based measures are critical at the same time. From the perspective of information retrieval, we are to facilitate effective and intuitively-interpretable methods for automatic keyword extraction. In this paper, we propose multiple content-based measures for the weights, contributions to document classifications and coverage of words. We give the measure based on the Laplaces law to determine the weight of a word in documents, and give the measure based on the concept of average mutual information to determine the influence of a word on document classifications. Furthermore, we propose the concept of semantic coacervation degree as the measure for the coverage of words on documents, and give a branch and bound algorithm to find the minimal set of keywords that maximize the coverage. By addressing these content-based measures one by one, the desired keywords can be extracted automatically from documents. Experimental results show that our methods are not only efficient but also feasible.

16166;"CSI-OMIM - Clinical Synopsis Search in OMIM";0;"Cohen, R.a  b  and Gefen, A.a  b  and Elhadad, M.b  and Birk, O.S.a ";"Background: The OMIM database is a tool used daily by geneticists. Syndrome pages include a Clinical Synopsis section containing a list of known phenotypes comprising a clinical syndrome. The phenotypes are in free text and different phrases are often used to describe the same phenotype, the differences originating in spelling variations or typing errors, varying sentence structures and terminological variants.These variations hinder searching for syndromes or using the large amount of phenotypic information for research purposes. In addition, negation forms also create false positives when searching the textual description of phenotypes and induce noise in text mining applications. Description: Our method allows efficient and complete search of OMIM phenotypes as well as improved data-mining of the OMIM phenome. Applying natural language processing, each phrase is tagged with additional semantic information using UMLS and MESH. Using a grammar based method, annotated phrases are clustered into groups denoting similar phenotypes. These groups of synonymous expressions enable precise search, as query terms can be matched with the many variations that appear in OMIM, while avoiding over-matching expressions that include the query term in a negative context. On the basis of these clusters, we computed pair-wise similarity among syndromes in OMIM. Using this new similarity measure, we identified 79,770 new connections between syndromes, an average of 16 new connections per syndrome. Our project is Web-based and available at http://fohs.bgu.ac.il/s2g/csiomim. Conclusions: The resulting enhanced search functionality provides clinicians with an efficient tool for diagnosis. This search application is also used for finding similar syndromes for the candidate gene prioritization tool S2G.The enhanced OMIM database we produced can be further used for bioinformatics purposes such as linking phenotypes and genes based on syndrome similarities and the known genes in Morbidmap.

16167;"Extracting semantic frames from thai medical-symptom unstructured text with unknown target-phrase boundaries";0;"Intarapaiboon, P. and Nantajeewarawat, E. and Theeramunkong, T.";"Due to the limitations of language-processing tools for the Thai language, pattern-based information extraction from Thai documents requires supplementary techniques. Based on sliding-window rule application and extraction filtering, we present a framework for extracting semantic information from medical-symptom phrases with unknown boundaries in Thai unstructured-text information entries. A supervised rule learning algorithm is employed for automatic construction of information extraction rules from hand-tagged training symptom phrases. Two filtering components are introduced: one uses a classification model to predict rule application across a symptom-phrase boundary based on instantiation features of rule internal wildcards, the other uses weighted classification confidence to resolve conflicts arising from overlapping extractions. In our experimental study, we focus our attention on two basic types of symptom phrasal descriptions: one is concerned with abnormal characteristics of some observable entities and the other with human-body locations at which primitive symptoms appear. The experimental results show that the filtering components improve precision while preserving recall satisfactorily.Â© 2011 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";18;"2011";"IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems";;"Article";"Outro artigo de outra conferência foi considerado duplicado deste.";"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79952178437&partnerID=40&md5=e786935c69ce4f0ba1b6dc2b93934456";"E94-D";"465-478";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"25/07/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"classificacao";"thai";"Inductive Rule Learning";"Precision, Recall";"null";"biomedicina";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"
16168;"GRAPH: A domain ontology-driven semantic graph auto extraction system";0;"Zhou, C. and Chen, H. and Tao, J.";"This paper presents sGRAPH - a domain ontology-driven semantic graph auto extraction system used to discover knowledge from text publications in traditional Chinese medicine. The traditional Chinese medicine language system (TCMLs), composed of an ontology schema and a knowledge base containing 153,692 words and 304,114 relations, is used as the domain ontology. The sGRAPH comprises two components: a user interface that interacts with users and the domain ontology-based semantic graph extraction algorithm. This algorithm is divided into five steps: text processing, semantic graph extraction, graph identification, keyword-based semantic graph search and the selectable enrichment to the knowledge base. When the knowledge base of TCMLs is used, the domain-specific words are extracted from sentences more accurately; and the hierarchical structure of the ontology can also be used to help identify the extracted graphs. The algorithm not only can extract relations between words that have already been annotated by relations in the knowledge base but also can predict the relations between words that have never been annotated by relations. The sGRAPH was developed and evaluated by extracting semantic graphs from 2000 publications which predicted 6778 relations that have never been found.

16170;"Learning to generate a table-of-contents with supportive knowledge";0;"Nguyen, V.C. and Nguyen, L.M. and Shimazu, A.";"In the text summarization field, a table-of-contents is a type of indicative summary that is especially suited for locating information in a long document, or a set of documents. It is also a useful summary for a reader to quickly get an overview of the entire contents. The current models for generating a table-of-contents produced relatively low quality output with many meaningless titles, or titles that have no overlapping meaning with the corresponding contents. This problem may be due to the lack of semantic information and topic information in those models. In this research, we propose to integrate supportive knowledge into the learning models to improve the quality of titles in a generated tableof- contents. The supportive knowledge is derived from a hierarchical clustering of words, which is built from a large collection of raw text, and a topic model, which is directly estimated from the training data. The relatively good results of the experiments showed that the semantic and topic information supplied by supportive knowledge have good effects on title generation, and therefore, they help to improve the quality of the generated table-of-contents.

16180;"An ontology-based measure to compute semantic similarity in biomedicine";0;"Batet, M. and SÃ¡nchez, D. and Valls, A.";"Proper understanding of textual data requires the exploitation and integration of unstructured and heterogeneous clinical sources, healthcare records or scientific literature, which are fundamental aspects in clinical and translational research. The determination of semantic similarity between word pairs is an important component of text understanding that enables the processing, classification and structuring of textual resources. In the past, several approaches for assessing word similarity by exploiting different knowledge sources (ontologies, thesauri, domain corpora, etc.) have been proposed. Some of these measures have been adapted to the biomedical field by incorporating domain information extracted from clinical data or from medical ontologies (such as MeSH or SNOMED CT). In this paper, these approaches are introduced and analyzed in order to determine their advantages and limitations with respect to the considered knowledge bases. After that, a new measure based on the exploitation of the taxonomical structure of a biomedical ontology is proposed. Using SNOMED CT as the input ontology, the accuracy of our proposal is evaluated and compared against other approaches according to a standard benchmark of manually ranked medical terms. The correlation between the results of the evaluated measures and the human experts ratings shows that our proposal outperforms most of the previous measures avoiding, at the same time, some of their limitations.

16181;"Selecting attributes for sentiment classification using feature relation networks";0;"Abbasi, A.a  and France, S.a  and Zhang, Z.b  and Chen, H.c ";"A major concern when incorporating large sets of diverse n-gram features for sentiment classification is the presence of noisy, irrelevant, and redundant attributes. These concerns can often make it difficult to harness the augmented discriminatory potential of extended feature sets. We propose a rule-based multivariate text feature selection method called Feature Relation Network (FRN) that considers semantic information and also leverages the syntactic relationships between n-gram features. FRN is intended to efficiently enable the inclusion of extended sets of heterogeneous n-gram features for enhanced sentiment classification. Experiments were conducted on three online review testbeds in comparison with methods used in prior sentiment classification research. FRN outperformed the comparison univariate, multivariate, and hybrid feature selection methods; it was able to select attributes resulting in significantly better classification accuracy irrespective of the feature subset sizes. Furthermore, by incorporating syntactic information about n-gram relations, FRN is able to select features in a more computationally efficient manner than many multivariate and hybrid techniques.

16185;"Modeling reciprocity in social interactions with probabilistic latent space models";0;"Girju, R.a  and Paul, M.J.a  b ";"Reciprocity is a pervasive concept that plays an important role in governing peoples behavior, judgments, and thus their social interactions. In this paper we present an analysis of the concept of reciprocity as expressed in English and a way to model it. At a larger structural level the reciprocity model will induce representations and clusters of relations between interpersonal verbs. In particular, we introduce an algorithm that semi-automatically discovers patterns encoding reciprocity based on a set of simple yet effective pronoun templates. Using the most frequently occurring patterns we queried the web and extracted 13,443 reciprocal instances, which represent a broad-coverage resource. Unsupervised clustering procedures are performed to generate meaningful semantic clusters of reciprocal instances. We also present several extensions (along with observations) to these models that incorporate meta-attributes like the verbs affective value, identify gender differences between participants, consider the textual context of the instances, and automatically discover verbs with certain presuppositions. The pattern discovery procedure yields an accuracy of 97 per cent, while the clustering procedures-clustering with pairwise membership and clustering with transitions-indicate accuracies of 91 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively. Our affective value clustering can predict an unknown verbs affective value (positive, negative, or neutral) with 51 per cent accuracy, while it can discriminate between positive and negative values with 68 per cent accuracy. The presupposition discovery procedure yields an accuracy of 97 per cent.

Furthermore, we propose a method to assess modified polarity based on Chinese dependency grammar. According to different dependency grammar relation, we can accurately identify subjective words and its modified polarity, then aggregate subjective words to predict sentence sentiment polarity.

16192;"A distributional semantics approach to simultaneous recognition of multiple classes of named entities";0;"Jonnalagadda, S.a  and Leaman, R.a  and Cohen, T.b  and Gonzalez, G.a ";"Named Entity Recognition and Classification is being studied for last two decades. Since semantic features take huge amount of training time and are slow in inference, the existing tools apply features and rules mainly at the word level or use lexicons. Recent advances in distributional semantics allow us to efficiently create paradigmatic models that encode word order. We used Sahlgren et als permutation-based variant of the Random Indexing model to create a scalable and efficient system to simultaneously recognize multiple entity classes mentioned in natural language, which is validated on the GENIA corpus which has annotations for 46 biomedical entity classes and supports nested entities. Using distributional semantics features only, it achieves an overall micro-averaged Fmeasure of 67.3% based on fragment matching with performance ranging from 7.4% for ""DNA substructure"" to 80.7% for ""Bioentity"".

It enables to reason which algorithms can be used to produce the results required by a specified knowledge discovery task, and to query the results of the knowledge discovery tasks. In addition, the ontology can also be used for automatic annotation of manually created workflows facilitating their reuse. Thus, the proposed framework provides an approach to third generation data mining: integration of distributed, heterogeneous data and knowledge resources and software into a coherent and effective knowledge discovery process.

Deep belief network constructs a deep architecture to obtain the high level abstraction of input data, which can be used to model the semantic correlation among words of documents. After basic features are selected by statistical feature selection measures, a deep belief network with discriminative fine tuning strategy is built on basic features to learn high level deep features. A support vector machine is then trained on the learned deep features. The proposed method outperforms traditional classifier based on support vector machine. As a dimension reduction strategy, the deep belief network also outperforms the traditional latent semantic indexing method. Detailed experiments are also made to show the effect of different fine tuning strategies and network structures on the performance of deep belief network.

One of the techniques that can address this need is sentiment mining. Existing approaches enable the analysis of a large number of text documents, mainly based on their statistical properties and possibly combined with numeric data. Most approaches are limited to simple word counts and largely ignore semantic and structural aspects of content. Yet, argumentation plays an important role in expressing and promoting an opinion. Therefore, we propose a framework that allows the incorporation of information on argumentation structure in the models for economic sentiment discovery in text.

A limitation of previous keyphrase extraction methods based on semantic analysis is that the acquisition of the semantic features within phrases is restricted by the constructed thesaurus and language. An approach to the acquisition of the semantic features within phrases from a single document is proposed in this paper, which is used to extract document keyphrases. Semantic relatedness degrees between phrases are computed using word co-occurrence information in the document, and the document is represented as a relatedness graph. Keyphrases are extracted based on the semantic relatedness features acquired from the graph. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed keyphrase extraction method always outperforms the baseline methods TFIDF and Kea. Furthermore, our approach is not domain-specific and the method generalizes well when it is trained on one domain (journal articles) and tested on another (news web pages).

It greatly reduces the text processing time and increases the accuracy because of removing some data outliers. With the rapid development of Web 2.0 and the further evolution of the Internet, short text like micro-blog plays an important role in peoples daily life. However, existing feature selection methods cannot effectively extract these short text features, and greatly reduce the classification and clustering performance of short text. In this regard, we propose a novel feature selection method based on part-of-speech and HowNet. According to the composition of the text property, we choose the words with larger amount of information by different part-of-speech, and then expand the semantic features of these words based on HowNet, in this way the short text has more useful features. We use test data set collected from sina micro-blog and adopt the micro average and macro average of F1-Measure to evaluate the effects of short text classification. The results show that the short text feature selected by our method has a good amount of information, as well as good classification results.

We use discriminative training to create a projection of documents from multiple languages into a single translingual vector space. We explore two variants to create these projections: Oriented Principal Component Analysis (OPCA) and Coupled Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (CPLSA). Both of these variants start with a basic model of documents (PCA and PLSA). Each model is then made discriminative by encouraging comparable document pairs to have similar vector representations. We evaluate these algorithms on two tasks: parallel document retrieval for Wikipedia and Europarl documents, and cross-lingual text classification on Reuters.

How to enhance the application of knowledge management systems (KMS) becomes a critical issue. One of the enhanced applications of KMS is the SOS system, which aims at sharing knowledge for solving emerging problems. While it takes time for experienced employees to share their knowledge via the SOS system, it is advantageous to introduce an Automatic Problem Answering (APA) mechanism. When an emerging problem is issued, the APA mechanism will find actively suitable knowledge from the Intellectual Asset Repository (IAR), which consists of various sources of knowledge. In this paper, a semantic segmentation method is proposed and is employed in building a semantic segmentation module (SSM) in APA. SSM will automatically extract the knowledge corpuses embedded in documents. The extracted knowledge corpuses will be reused in APA to solve emergent problems and thus the application of KMS is enhanced.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";9;"2010";"2010 - 27th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2010";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84863740797&partnerID=40&md5=3d54f4e93185c506ac3b07e0926e08bf";;"578-587";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"25/07/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"semantic segmentation, gerenciamento de conhecimento";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

It is based on a combination of hybrid shallow-deep components arranged within the middleware framework Heart of Gold. The shallowdeep semantic analysis employs Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS) as a common semantic underspecification formalism for natural language processing components. In order to compute efficiently first-order representations of the input text, the intermediate RMRS results of the shallow-deep analysis are transformed into the dominance constraints formalism and resolved by the underspecification resolver UTool. First-order expressions can serve as a formal knowledge representation of natural text and thus can be utilized in knowledge engineering or textual reasoning.

16223;"Supporting natural language processing with background knowledge: Coreference resolution case";0;"Bryl, V. and Giuliano, C. and Serafini, L. and Tymoshenko, K.";"Systems based on statistical and machine learning methods have been shown to be extremely effective and scalable for the analysis of large amount of textual data. However, in the recent years, it becomes evident that one of the most important directions of improvement in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, like word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, relation extraction, and other tasks related to knowledge extraction, is by exploiting semantics. While in the past, the unavailability of rich and complete semantic descriptions constituted a serious limitation of their applicability, nowadays, the Semantic Web made available a large amount of logically encoded information (e.g. ontologies, RDF(S)-data, linked data, etc.), which constitutes a valuable source of semantics. However, web semantics cannot be easily plugged into machine learning systems. Therefore the objective of this paper is to define a reference methodology for combining semantic information available in the web under the form of logical theories, with statistical methods for NLP. The major problems that we have to solve to implement our methodology concern (i) the selection of the correct and minimal knowledge among the large amount available in the web, (ii) the representation of uncertain knowledge, and (iii) the resolution and the encoding of the rules that combine knowledge retrieved from Semantic Web sources with semantics in the text. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of our approach, we present an application of the methodology to the problem of intra-document coreference resolution, and we show by means of some experiments on the standard dataset, how the injection of knowledge leads to the improvement of this task performance.

Specifically, the explored entities were the SNOMED CT terms having the semantic categories finding or disorder. The study showed that the proportion of negated clinical entities was around 9%.

We distinguish two broad types of social events depending on whether only one or both parties are aware of the social contact. We annotate part of Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data, and perform experiments using Support Vector Machines with Kernel methods. We use a combination of structures derived from phrase structure trees and dependency trees. A characteristic of our events (which distinguishes them from ACE events) is that the participating entities can be spread far across the parse trees. We use syntactic and semantic insights to devise a new structure derived from dependency trees and show that this plays a role in achieving the best performing system for both social event detection and classification tasks. We also use three data sampling approaches to solve the problem of data skewness. Sampling methods improve the F1-measure for the task of relation detection by over 20% absolute over the baseline.

Most existing studies detect bursty features based purely on term frequency changes without taking into account the semantic contexts of terms, and as a result the detected bursty features may not always be interesting or easy to interpret. In this paper we propose to model the contexts of bursty features using a language modeling approach. We then propose a novel topic diversity-based metric using the context models to find newsworthy bursty features. We also propose to use the context models to automatically assign meaningful tags to bursty features. Using a large corpus of a stream of news articles, we quantitatively show that the proposed context language models for bursty features can effectively help rank bursty features based on their newsworthiness and to assign meaningful tags to annotate bursty features.

16231;"Supervising latent topic model for maximum-margin text classification and regression";0;"Xu, W.";"In this paper, we investigate the text classification and regression problems: given a corpus of text documents as training, each of which has a response label, the task is to train a predictor for predicting its response of any given document. In previous work, many researchers decompose this task into two separate steps: they first use a generative latent topic model to learn low-dimensional semantic representations of documents; and then train a max-margin predictor using them as features. In this work we demonstrate that it is beneficial to combine both steps of learning low-dimensional representations and training a predictor into one step of minimizing a singe learning objective. We present a novel step-wise convex optimization algorithm which solves this objective properly via a tight variational upper bound. We conduct an extensive experimental study on public available movie review and 20 Newsgroups datasets. Experimental results show that compared with state of art results in the literature, our one step approach can train noticeably better predictors and discover much lower-dimensional representations: a 2% relative accuracy improvement and a 95% relative number of dimensions reduction in the classification task on the Newsgroups dataset; and a 5.7% relative predictive R 2 improvement and a 55% relative number of dimensions reduction in the regression task on the movie review dataset.

For using one of traditional approaches to text clustering, documents should be encoded into numerical vectors; encoding so causes the two main problems: the huge dimensionality and the sparse distribution.

By encoding documents into another form, we attempt to avoid the two main problems, completely. As the empirical validation, the proposed approach will be compared with others with respect to the clustering performance and speed.

Reducing the overlapping between the topic-word distributions makes the learned topics more interpretable in the sense that each topic word-distribution can be clearly associated to a distinctive semantic meaning.

Existing ontology-based document representation methods are static, hence, the chosen semantic concept set for representing a document has a fixed resolution and it is not adaptable to the characteristics of a document collection and the text mining problem in hand. We propose an Adaptive Concept Resolution (ACR) model to overcome this issue. ACR can learn a concept border from an ontology taking into consideration of the characteristics of a particular document collection. Then this border can provide a tailor-made semantic concept representation for a document coming from the same domain. Another advantage of ACR is that it is applicable in both classification task where the groups are given in the training document set, and clustering task where no group information is available. Furthermore, the result of this model is not sensitive to the model parameter. The experimental results show that ACR outperforms an existing static method significantly.

16240;"Validating meronymy hypotheses with support vector machines and graph kernels";0;"Vor Der BrÃ¼ck, T. and Helbig, H.";"There is a substantial body of work on the extraction of relations from texts, most of which is based on pattern matching or on applying tree kernel functions to syntactic structures. Whereas pattern application is usually more efficient, tree kernels can be superior when assessed by the F-measure. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach to extracting meronymy relations, which is based on both patterns and kernel functions. In a first step, meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from a text corpus by applying patterns. In a second step these relation hypotheses are validated by using several shallow features and a graph kernel approach. In contrast to other meronymy extraction and validation methods which are based on surface or syntactic representations we use a purely semantic approach based on semantic networks. This involves analyzing each sentence of the Wikipedia corpus by a deep syntactico-semantic parser and converting it into a semantic network. Meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from the semantic networks by means of an automated theorem prover, which employs a set of logical axioms and patterns in the form of semantic networks. The meronymy candidates are then validated by means of a graph kernel approach based on common walks. The evaluation shows that this method achieves considerably higher accuracy, recall, and F-measure than a method using purely shallow validation.

16242;"Towards conversation entailment: An empirical investigation";0;"Zhang, C. and Chai, J.Y.";"While a significant amount of research has been devoted to textual entailment, automated entailment from conversational scripts has received less attention. To address this limitation, this paper investigates the problem of conversation entailment: automated inference of hypotheses from conversation scripts. We examine two levels of semantic representations: a basic representation based on syntactic parsing from conversation utterances and an augmented representation taking into consideration of conversation structures. For each of these levels, we further explore two ways of capturing long distance relations between language constituents: implicit modeling based on the length of distance and explicit modeling based on actual patterns of relations. Our empirical findings have shown that the augmented representation with conversation structures is important, which achieves the best performance when combined with explicit modeling of long distance relations.

Therefore, the ability to use this information to perform domain-specific entity recognition and event-related sentence classification, which in turn can support time and space visualization of automatically extracted events, is highly desirable. Towards this goal, we present a rule-based approach to the problem of extracting animal disease-related events from web documents. Our approach relies on the recognition of structured entity tuples, consisting of attributes, which describe events related to animal diseases. The event attributes that we consider include animal diseases, dates, species and geo-referenced locations. We perform disease names and species recognition using an automatically- constructed ontology, dates are extracted using regular expressions, while location are extracted using a conditional random fields tool. The extracted events are further classified as confirmed or suspected based on semantic features, obtained from the e.g., GoogleSets1 and WordNet2.

16247;"SenticNet: A publicly available semantic resource for opinion mining";0;"Cambria, E.a  and Speer, R.b  and Havasi, C.b  and Hussain, A.a ";"Today millions of web-users express their opinions about many topics through blogs, wikis, fora, chats and social networks. For sectors such as e-commerce and e-tourism, it is very useful to automatically analyze the huge amount of social information available on the Web, but the extremely unstructured nature of these contents makes it a difficult task. SenticNet is a publicly available resource for opinion mining built exploiting AI and Semantic Web techniques. It uses dimensionality reduction to infer the polarity of common sense concepts and hence provide a public resource for mining opinions from natural language text at a semantic, rather than just syntactic, level.

16249;"Identifying influential bloggers using blogs semantics";0;"Aziz, M. and Rafi, M.";"Web 2.0 has brought a lot of good things for internet audience. Interactive user generated contents like blogs, become a popular means to voice ones opinion related to anything. The blogosphere contains a lot of users generated contents, a growing readerships and ever increasing thoughts followers. Identifying influential bloggers is a recently introduced phenomenon; influential bloggers have prospects in bringing a great value to business. They can convince their fellow bloggers on variety of grounds, react to the news event and bring a three sixty degree view of the news, create a new thought or perception and can get people under their discernment by their power of thought and content creation. There are many researchers that proposed influential bloggers mining systems, but all these systems suffer from drawbacks like: domain driven, generalized shallow influential measure and validation and verification. We propose in this paper, an effective algorithm to identify influential bloggers by using influence measuring factors. These factors are based on contents semantics of their blog-posts, quantitative analysis of the contents and fellow readerships with their comments on the post. We applied this algorithm, on a subset of political blogosphere of Pakistan, where we have successfully able to indentify influential bloggers; proactive spreads of their influential thinking, and changing views of the fellow readers. We believe that this algorithm can be extended to identify an influential group in groups blogging.

16254;"Automatic taxonomy extraction through mining social networks";0;"Kubek, M. and Nutzel, J. and Zimmermann, F.";"Social networks are a hugely popular part of the Internet. Not only do they offer a convenient way for like-minded people to get in contact with each other, they also represent a valuable knowledge resource. For instance, people publish personal images with own descriptive attributes, or they annotate music while listening to it. These attributes can be of general or rather specific nature, assigned according to the knowledge of the tagging person. Due to the fact that many people annotate the same items with topically related words, often a common agreement regarding their semantic categorization is achieved. This approach is often referred to as building a folksonomy, a portmanteau of the words folk and taxonomy. Unlike this term suggests, a taxonomy cannot be explicitly obtained by simply analyzing the tags of a set of items. This paper presents a method to automatically extract taxonomies from social networks by analyzing co-occurring terms assigned to items and calculating their semantic hierarchy, more precisely by determining the super- and subclasses of terms from a specific tag set based on conditional relative frequencies. Furthermore, practical benefits derived from this method, e.g. to calculate similarities of maybe sparsely or completely differently annotated items, are discussed as well. Additionally, these techniques can also be used to detect inconsistencies among annotations of a specific item.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";4;"2010";"8th International Workshop for Technical, Economic and Legal Aspects of Business Models for Virtual Goods, Incorporating the 6th International Open Digital Rights Language Workshop, ODRL 2009";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871367356&partnerID=40&md5=a73e5f2881e994c5654f53c451276d10";;"107-114";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"26/07/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"relacoes semanticas";"null";"null";"null";"null";"construcao automatica de ontologia, analise de redes sociais";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

16257;"Learning compressible models";0;"Zhang, Y.a  and Schneider, J.b  and Dubrawski, A.b ";"In this paper, we study the combination of compression and l1-norm regularization in a machine learning context: learning compressible models. By including a compression operation into the l1 regularization, the assumption on model sparsity is relaxed to compressibility: model coefficients are compressed before being penalized, and sparsity is achieved in a compressed domain rather than the original space. We focus on the design of different compression operations, by which we can encode various compressibility assumptions and inductive biases, e.g., piecewise local smoothness, compacted energy in the frequency domain, and semantic correlation. We show that use of a compression operation provides an opportunity to leverage auxiliary information from various sources, e.g., domain knowledge, coding theories, unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on brain-computer interfacing, handwritten character recognition and text classification. Empirical results show clear improvements in prediction performance by including compression in l1 regularization. We also analyze the learned model coefficients under appropriate compressibility assumptions, which further demonstrate the advantages of learning compressible models instead of sparse models.

16258;"Enhanced semantic automatic ontology enrichment";0;"Harb, A.a  and Hajlaoui, K.b ";"With the fast growing development of the Web, the adoption of ontologies to improve the exploitation of information resources, is already heralded as a promising model of representation. However, the relevance of information that they contain requires regular updating, and specifically, the addition of new knowledge. Recently, new research approaches were defined in order to automatically enrich ontology. Usually they extensively use either statistical models or experts to provide the relevance and placement of new concepts. Unfortunately these approaches suffer the following drawback: The detection of new elements and position in ontology are not automatically established, and lack of use of semantic or syntactic information to extract relations between concepts. In this paper, we present an approach for ontology enrichment based on two steps where a novel effective filtering step is utilized. First we extract the correlation between terms of a learning dataset using the generation of association rules. Second we retain the relevant new concepts using an extracted semantic information. The suggested approach was tested on an ontology of mechanical industry competencies. Experiments were performed on real data, which show the usefulness of our approach.

16259;"Semantic content filtering with wikipedia and ontologies";0;"Malo, P. and Siitari, P. and Ahlgren, O. and Wallenius, J. and Korhonen, P.";"The use of domain knowledge is generally found to improve query efficiency in content filtering applications. In particular, tangible benefits have been achieved when using knowledge-based approaches within more specialized fields, such as medical free texts or legal documents. However, the problem is that sources of domain knowledge are time consuming to build and equally costly to maintain. As a potential remedy, recent studies on Wikipedia suggest that this large body of socially constructed knowledge can be effectively harnessed to provide not only facts but also accurate information about semantic concept-similarities. This paper describes a ramework for document filtering, where Wikipedias concept relatedness information is combined with a domain ontology to produce semantic content classifiers. The approach is evaluated using Reuters RCV1 corpus and TREC-11 filtering task definitions. In a comparative study, the approach shows robust performance and appears to outperform content classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and C4.5 algorithm.

16261;"Detecting speculative language using syntactic dependencies and logistic regression";0;"Vlachos, A. and Craven, M.";"In this paper we describe our approach to the CoNLL-2010 shared task on detecting speculative language in biomedical text. We treat the detection of sentences containing uncertain information (Task1) as a token classification task since the existence or absence of cues determines the sentence label. We distinguish words that have speculative and non-speculative meaning by employing syntactic features as a proxy for their semantic content. In order to identify the scope of each cue (Task2), we learn a classifier that predicts whether each token of a sentence belongs to the scope of a given cue. The features in the classifier are based on the syntactic dependency path between the cue and the token.

16262;"Monitoring conceptual development with text mining technologies: CONSPECT";0;"Wild, F. and Haley, D. and BÃ¼low, K.";"This paper evaluates CONSPECT, a service that analyses states in a learners conceptual development. It combines two technologies - Latent Semantic Analysis to analyse text and Network Analysis (NA) to provide visualisations - into a technique called Meaningful Interaction Analysis (MIA). CONSPECT was designed to help both online learners and their tutors monitor their conceptual development. This paper reports on the validation experiments undertaken to determine how well LSA matches first year medical students in clustering concepts and in annotating text. The validation used several techniques, including card sorting and Likert scales. CONSPECT produces almost peer quality results and what remains to be tested is whether it improves with more advanced learners. One of the experiments showed an average 0.7 correlation between humans and CONSPECT.

16266;"PTM: Probabilistic topic mapping model for mining parallel document collections";0;"Zhang, D.a  and Sun, J.b  and Zhai, C.a  and Bose, A.b  and Anerousis, N.b ";"Many applications generate a large volume of parallel document collections. A parallel document collection consists of two sets of documents where the documents in each set correspond to each other and form semantic pairs (e.g., pairs of problem and solution descriptions in a help-desk setting). Although much work has been done on text mining, little previous work has attempted to mine such a novel kind of text data. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic topic model, called Probabilistic Topic Mapping (PTM) model, to mine parallel document collections to simultaneously discover latent topics in both sets of documents as well as the mapping of topics in one set to those in the other. We evaluate the PTM model on a parallel document collection in IT service domain. We show that PTM can effectively discover meaningful topics, as well as their mappings, and its also useful for improving text matching and retrieval when theres a vocabulary gap.

16267;"Emotion sensing for Internet chatting: A Web mining approach for affective categorization of events";0;"Lu, C.-Y. and Hsu, W.W.Y. and Peng, H.-T. and Chung, J.-M. and Ho, J.-M.";"This study proposes an emotion detection engine for real time Internet chatting applications. We adopt a Web-scale text mining approach that automates the categorization of affection state of daily events. We first accumulated a huge collection of real-life entities from Web that would participate in events with a user in the chatting room. Based on the common actions between each entity and the type of the user in a chatting room session, such as boy, girl, old man and so on, each collected entity was automatically classified into different affective categories such as pleasant, provoking, grievous, and scary. During a chatting session, each sentence is first parsed using semantic roles labeling techniques to retrieve the verb and object of the event embedded in the sentence. Based on a set of manually authored emotion generation rule, the system then assigns the emotion based on the verb and the affective categories of the object. Primitive evaluations show that the precision rate of the emotion detection engine is rather satisfactory for applications that distinguish emotions of Happiness, Sadness, Anger, and Fear.

16275;"Sentence-level and document-level sentiment mining for arabic texts";0;"Farra, N. and Challita, E. and Assi, R.A. and Hajj, H.";"In this work, we investigate sentiment mining of Arabic text at both the sentence level and the document level. Existing research in Arabic sentiment mining remains very limited. For sentence-level classification, we investigate two approaches. The first is a novel grammatical approach that employs the use of a general structure for the Arabic sentence. The second approach is based on the semantic orientation of words and their corresponding frequencies, to do this we built an interactive learning semantic dictionary which stores the polarities of the roots of different words and identifies new polarities based on these roots. For document-level classification, we use sentences of known classes to classify whole documents, using a novel approach whereby documents are divided dynamically into chunks and classification is based on the semantic contributions of different chunks in the document. This dynamic chunking approach can also be investigated for sentiment mining in other languages. Finally, we propose a hierarchical classification scheme that uses the results of the sentence-level classifier as input to the document-level classifier, an approach which has not been investigated previously for Arabic documents. We also pinpoint the various challenges that are faced by sentiment mining for Arabic texts and propose suggestions for its development. We demonstrate promising results with our sentence-level approach, and our document-level experiments show, with high accuracy, that it is feasible to extract the sentiment of an Arabic document based on the classes of its sentences.

16276;"Chinese question classification using multilevel random walk";0;"Zhang, K. and Zhao, J.";"Question classification is crucial for the automatically question answering. And Random Walk is a promising approach for semi-supervised learning problems of learning from labeled and unlabeled data. Given a set of points, some of them are labeled, and the remaining points are unlabeled, the goal is to predict the labels of the unlabeled points. Since labeling often requires expensive human labor, whereas unlabelled data is easier to obtain, semi-supervised learning is very useful in many real-world problems, such as text classification. Here we proposed an approach for Chinese question Classification using Multilevel Random Walk (MRK), which is an improvement of random walk.

Then we can derive topic-specific n-gram counts from the classified texts. Finally we build topic-specific n-gram language models (LM) from the n-gram counts using traditional n-gram modeling approach. In decoding we perform topic inference from the processing context, and we use unsupervised topic adaptation approach to combine the topic-specific models. Experimental results show that the suggested method outperforms the state-of-the-art topic-model-based unsupervised adaptation approaches.

Failure in proper management of knowledge leads to incorrect results returned by search engines. Therefore, the web should have an effective information retrieval system to improve the correctness of retrieval results. This study provides a method to assign a new document to the fittest category out of predefined categories, where latent semantic analysis (LSA) is used to evaluate each term in documents, the similarity between terms and documents as well as the one between terms and categories. The objective of our method is to fuse evidential reasoning method with LSA which can assign a new document to a predefined category. The method provides better results in performance of classification comparing to the fusion of an evidential reasoning approach with term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF).

16281;"A verb-centric approach for relationship extraction in biomedical text";0;"Sharma, A. and Swaminathan, R. and Yang, H.";"Advances in biomedical technology and research have resulted in a large number of research findings, which are primarily published in unstructured text such as journal articles. Text mining techniques have been thus employed to extract knowledge from such data. In this article we focus on the task of identifying and extracting relations between bio-entities such as green tea and breast cancer. Unlike previous work that employs heuristics such as co-occurrence patterns and handcrafted syntactic rules, we propose a verb-centric algorithm. This algorithm identifies and extracts the main verb(s) in a sentence; therefore, it does not require the usage of predefined rules or patterns. Using the main verb(s) it then extracts the two involved entities of a relationship. The biomedical entities are identified using a dependence parse tree by applying syntactic and linguistic features such as preposition phrases and semantic role analysis. The proposed verb-centric approach can effectively handle complex sentence structures such as clauses and conjunctive sentences. We evaluate the algorithm on several datasets and achieve an average F-score of 0.905, which is significantly higher than that of previous work.

16284;"Query-relevant document representation for text clustering";0;"Makrehchi, M.";"In text categorization, one well-known document representation is bag-of-words. Although it is simple and popular, it ignores semantics, underlying linguistic information, and word correlations. In this paper, a new representation for text data is proposed which is called Bag-Of-Queries (BOQ). First, a taxonomy of the terms in the local vocabulary is extracted. Extracting a taxonomy is performed by learning term dependencies using an information theoretic inclusion index. Next, the taxonomy is partitioned to generate a set of correlated terms or bag of queries. Since every two partitions belong to different concepts, they are considered semantically orthogonal queries. This provides a new space of orthogonal features, which is necessary for an efficient categorization. Finally, instead of using terms as features, we use them to build a set of queries. Documents are ranked in response to the queries using a similarity measure. The similarity indices are considered as new features in a vector space model representation. The proposed approach outperforms bag of word based clustering. It also extracts new non-redundant features and at the same time reduces dimensionality.

16286;"Inducing domain-specific semantic class taggers from (almost) nothing";0;"Huang, R. and Riloff, E.";"This research explores the idea of inducing domain-specific semantic class taggers using only a domain-specific text collection and seed words. The learning process begins by inducing a classifier that only has access to contextual features, forcing it to generalize beyond the seeds. The contextual classifier then labels new instances, to expand and diversify the training set. Next, a cross-category bootstrapping process simultaneously trains a suite of classifiers for multiple semantic classes. The positive instances for one class are used as negative instances for the others in an iterative bootstrapping cycle. We also explore a one-semantic-class-per-discourse heuristic, and use the classifiers to dynamically create semantic features. We evaluate our approach by inducing six semantic taggers from a collection of veterinary medicine message board posts.

16287;"Developing a dataset for technology structure mining";0;"QasemiZadeh, B. and Buitelaar, P. and Monaghan, F.";"This paper describes steps that have been taken to construct a development dataset for the task of Technology Structure Mining. We have defined the proposed task as the process of mapping a scientific corpus into a labeled digraph named a Technology Structure Graph as described in the paper. The generated graph expresses the domain semantics in terms of interdependencies between pairs of technologies that are named (introduced) in the target scientific corpus. The dataset comprises a set of sentences extracted from the ACL Anthology Corpus. Each sentence is annotated with at least two technologies in the domain of Human Language Technology and the interdependence between them. The annotations - technology mark-up and their interdependencies - are expressed at two layers: lexical and termino-conceptual. Lexical representation of technologies comprises varying lexicalizations of a technology. However, at the termino-conceptual layer all these lexical variations refer to the same concept. We have adopted the same approach for representing Semantic Relations; at the lexical layer a semantic relation is a predicate i.e. defined based on the sentence surface structure; however at the termino-conceptual layer semantic relations are classified into conceptual relations either taxonomic or non-taxonomic. Morover, the contexts that interdependencies are extracted from are classified into five groups based on the linguistic criteria and syntactic structure that are identified by the human annotators. The dataset initially comprises of 482 sentences. We hope this effort results in a benchmark that can be used for the technology structure mining task as defined in the paper.

16295;"Exploiting semantic associative information in topic modeling";0;"Wu, M.-S. and Lee, H.-S. and Wang, H.-M.";"Topic modeling has been widely applied in a variety of text modeling tasks as well as in speech recognition systems for effectively capturing the semantic and statistic information in documents or speech utterances. Most topic models rely on the bag-of-words assumption that results in learned latent topics composed of lists of individual words. Unfortunately, these words may convey topical information but lack accurate semantic knowledge of the text. In this paper, we present the semantic associative topic model, where the concept of the semantic association terms is extended to topic modeling, which provides guidance on modeling the semantic associations that occur among single words by expressing a document as an association of multiple words.

16298;"Analysis of collaborative writing processes using hidden markov models and semantic heuristics";0;"Southavilay, V.a  and Yacef, K.a  and Calvo, R.A.b ";"In this paper we are interested in discovering collaborative writing patterns in student data collected from a system we designed to support student collaborative writing, and which has been used by over 1,000 students in the past year. A particular functionality that we are investigating is the extraction and display to learners and teachers of the process followed during the course of the writing. We used a heuristic to derive semantic interpretation of specific sequences of raw data and Markov models (MM) to derive the processes. We propose two models, a Heuristic MM and a Hidden MM for analysing students writing behavior. We also refined the semantic preprocessing by adding the notion of pauses between activities. We illustrate our approach and compare these models using real data from two groups of high and low performance level and highlight the different information they each provide.

16301;"Using text to build semantic networks for pharmacogenomics";0;"Coulet, A.a  b  and Shah, N.H.a  and Garten, Y.c  and Musen, M.a  and Altman, R.B.a  b  c  d ";"Most pharmacogenomics knowledge is contained in the text of published studies, and is thus not available for automated computation. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for extracting relationships in specific domains often rely on hand-built rules and domain-specific ontologies to achieve good performance. In a new and evolving field such as pharmacogenomics (PGx), rules and ontologies may not be available. Recent progress in syntactic NLP parsing in the context of a large corpus of pharmacogenomics text provides new opportunities for automated relationship extraction. We describe an ontology of PGx relationships built starting from a lexicon of key pharmacogenomic entities and a syntactic parse of more than 87 million sentences from 17 million MEDLINE abstracts. We used the syntactic structure of PGx statements to systematically extract commonly occurring relationships and to map them to a common schema. Our extracted relationships have a 70-87.7% precision and involve not only key PGx entities such as genes, drugs, and phenotypes (e.g., VKORC1, warfarin, clotting disorder), but also critical entities that are frequently modified by these key entities (e.g., VKORC1 polymorphism, warfarin response, clotting disorder treatment). The result of our analysis is a network of 40,000 relationships between more than 200 entity types with clear semantics. This network is used to guide the curation of PGx knowledge and provide a computable resource for knowledge discovery.

16303;"Ontology-based anonymization of categorical values";0;"MartÃ­nez, S. and SÃ¡nchez, D. and Valls, A.";"The analysis of sensible data requires a proper anonymization of values in order to preserve the privacy of individuals. Information loss should be minimized during the masking process in order to enable a proper exploitation of data. Even though several masking methods have been designed for numerical data, very few of them deal with categorical (textual) information. In this case, the quality of the anonymized dataset is closely related to the preservation of semantics, a dimension which is commonly neglected of shallowly considered in related words. In this paper, a new masking method for unbounded categorical attributes is proposed. It relies on the knowledge modeled in ontologies in order to semantically interpret the input data and perform data transformations aiming to minimize the loss of semantic content. On the contrary to exhaustive methods based on simple hierarchical structures, our approach relies on a set of heuristics in order to guide and optimize the masking process, ensuring its scalability when dealing with big and heterogenous datasets and wide ontologies. The evaluation performed over real textual data suggests that our method is able to produce anonymized datasets which significantly preserve data semantics in comparison to apporaches based on data distribution metrics.

16308;"Hypergraph-based multilevel matrix approximation for text information retrieval";0;"Fang, H.-R. and Saad, Y.";"In Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a collection of documents is often pre-processed to form a sparse term-document matrix, followed by a computation of a low-rank approximation to the data matrix. A multilevel framework based on hypergraph coarsening is presented which exploits the hypergraph that is canonically associated with the sparse term-document matrix representing the data. The main goal is to reduce the cost of the matrix approximation without sacrificing accuracy. Because coarsening by multilevel hypergraph techniques is a form of clustering, the proposed approach can be regarded as a hybrid of factorization-based LSI and clustering-based LSI. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves good improvement of the retrieval performance at a reduced cost.

Based on this, formal concepts in the concept lattice are extracted to represent the texts. In addition, similarity function between concepts is defined. To address the drawbacks of the existing K-Means algorithm, such as random selection of initial center, a method is proposed which takes into account the density and distance factors comprehensively.

16311;"The effect of different context representations on word sense discrimination in biomedical texts";0;"Pedersen, T.";"Unsupervised word sense discrimination relies on the idea that words that occur in similar contexts will have similar meanings. These techniques cluster multiple contexts in which an ambiguous word occurs, and the number of clusters discovered indicates the number of senses in which the ambiguous word is used. One important distinction among these methods is the underlying means of representing the contexts to be clustered. This paper compares the efficacy of first-order methods that directly represent the features that occur in a context with several second-order methods that use a more indirect representation. The experiments in this paper show that second order methods that use word by word co-occurrence matrices result in the highest accuracy and most robust word sense discrimination. These experiments were conducted on MedLine abstracts that contained pseudo - words created by conflating together pairs of MeSH preferred terms to create new ambiguous words. The experiments were carried out with SenseClusters, a freely available open source software package.

Reviewers usually praise a product in some aspects and bemoan it in other aspects. With the business globalization, it is very important for enterprises to extract the opinions toward different aspects and find out cross-lingual/cross-culture difference in opinions. Cross-lingual opinion mining is a very challenging task as amounts of opinions are written in different languages, and not well structured. Since people usually use different words to describe the same aspect in the reviews, product-feature (PF) categorization becomes very critical in cross-lingual opinion mining. Manual cross-lingual PF categorization is time consuming, and practically infeasible for the massive amount of data written in different languages. In order to effectively find out cross-lingual difference in opinions, we present an aspect-oriented opinion mining method with Cross-lingual Latent Semantic Association (CLaSA). We first construct CLaSA model to learn the cross-lingual latent semantic association among all the PFs from multi-dimension semantic clues in the review corpus. Then we employ CLaSA model to categorize all the multilingual PFs into semantic aspects, and summarize cross-lingual difference in opinions towards different aspects. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared with the existing approaches.

One of them is how to index the inherently large and heterogeneous lifelog data so that a person can efficiently retrieve the log segments that are of interest.

By quantizing the heterogeneous high dimensional sensory data into text representation, we are able to apply statistical natural language processing techniques to index, recognize, segment, cluster, retrieve, and infer high-level semantic meanings of the collected lifelogs. Based on this indexing approach, our lifelog system supports easy retrieval of log segments representing past similar activities and generation of salient summaries serving as overviews of segments.

16320;"Document clustering of MEDLINE abstracts based on non-negative matrix factorization using local confidence assessment";0;"Kang, B.-C.a  and Sur, Z.-W.b  and Park, C.c  and Cho, M.-G.d ";"A document search in PubMed is certainly one of the most exhaustive ways for finding information related to any biological or biomedical topic. However, a keyword search in this database that is not specific enough will provide a number of results that exceeds by far an amount of documents the user can read through one by one. In this work, we therefore present a new document clustering tool called Med- Clus for bioinformaticians in order to make a keyword search result from PubMed more concise by grouping such a set of documents into clusters. MedClus contains two modules. First, a pre-clustering module that creates the data matrix. This matrix contains term-document frequencies according to the TF*IDF method and optional weights. These weights are given by comparing the term list with the MeSH terms contained in the related MEDLINE abstracts. Second, it contains a clustering module, which is based on a Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm that finds an approximate factorization of the data matrix. This application was tested in different experiments evaluating its performance and reliability. Based on these results, a list of recommended ranges for crucial parameters such as the number of clusters was edited in order to constitute an user assistance for the application of Med- Clus. Finally, some results were analyzed by scientists from the field of medicine and biology, who evaluated the relevance of the terms and the existence of a relation between them. MedClus is a tool that is able to re-structure the result list of a keyword search for documents in PubMed. This is done by extracting terms before and finding latent semantics during the clustering process. Also, it optionally applies weights to terms that also appear as MeSH terms in at least one of the MEDLINE abstracts. Therefore, it helps users to refine a search result in PubMed via term-based clustering in order to economize time and efforts. At this development stage, the software is suitable for experienced users such as bioinformaticians, database administrators and developers. Also Web service for Semantic Toxicogenomics Knowledgebase, available at http://stkb2. labkm.net, has applied this technology to provide comprehensive and accurate relations between chemical and toxicological contexts.

Accordingly, it is worth to develop algorithms to verify whether near-synonyms do match the given contexts. In this paper, we consider the near-synonym substitution task as a classification task, where a classifier is trained for each near-synonym set to classify test examples into one of the near-synonyms in the set. We also propose the use of discriminative training to improve classifiers by distinguishing positive and negative features for each nearsynonym.

16322;"Enhancing Short Text Clustering with Small External Repositories";0;"Petersen, H. and Poon, J.";"The automatic clustering of textual data according to their semantic concepts is a challenging, yet important task. Choosing an appropriate method to apply when clustering text depends on the nature of the documents being analysed. For example, traditional clustering algorithms can struggle to correctly model collections of very short text due to their extremely sparse nature. In recent times, much attention has been directed to finding methods for adequately clustering short text. Many popular approaches employ large, external document repositories, such as Wikipedia or the Open Directory Project, to incorporate additional world knowledge into the clustering process. However the sheer size of many of these external collections can make these techniques difficult or time consuming to apply. This paper also employs external document collections to aid short text clustering performance. The external collections are referred to in this paper as Background Knowledge. In contrast to most previous literature a separate collection of Background Knowledge is obtained for each short text dataset. However, this Background Knowledge contains several orders of magnitude fewer documents than commonly used repositories like Wikipedia. A simple approach is described where the Background Knowledge is used to re-express short text in terms of a much richer feature space. A discussion of how best to cluster documents in this feature space is presented. A solution is proposed, and an experimental evaluation is performed that demonstrates significant improvement over clustering based on standard metrics with several publicly available datasets represented in the richer feature space.

16335;"Research of technical development trend and hot points based on text mining";0;"Zhang, L.-W.a  and Zhu, D.-H.b ";"Many methods have been developed to recognize those progresses of technologies, and one of them is to analyze patent information. However, current analysis methods for patent documents have some drawbacks. For example, previous researchers mainly paid attention to the structured item in patent documents such as patent number, filing date other than the unstructured item such as claims, abstracts and so on. However, many methods were not full and lots of valuable information can not be gained. Therefore, we proposed a new method based on text mining to handle not only structured items but also unstructured items in this paper. With collected keywords of a target technology field, we represented patent documents in vector space model and cluster patent documents by the kohonens self-organising neural network algorithm. With the clustering results, we formed a semantic network of keywords without respect of filing dates. And a technical development trend graph was built up by rearranging each keyword node of the semantic network according to its earliest filing date and frequency in patent documents. Then we calculateed the value of keywords indices such as the relative growth and relative share and visualize the analysis results to get the technical hot points graph. Our approach contributes to considering both structured and unstructured items of a patent document. Besides, ours visualizes a clear overview of technology information in a more comprehensible way. And as a result of those contributions, it enables us to understand advances of emerging technologies and technical hot points at present, and it helps us to have an insight to the technology field, thereby to avoid unnecessary investments.

16342;"A two-stage feature selection method for text categorization";0;"Meng, J.a  b  and Lin, H.a ";"Feature selection for text classification is a well-studied problem and the goals are improving classification effectiveness, computational efficiency, or both. In this paper, we propose a two-stage feature selection algorithm based on a kind of feature selection method and latent semantic indexing. Traditional wordmatching based text categorization system uses vector space model to represent the document. However, it needs a high dimensional space to represent the document, and does not take into account the semantic relationship between terms, which can also lead to poor classification accuracy. Latent semantic indexing can overcome the problems caused by using statistically derived conceptual indices instead of individual words. It constructs a conceptual vector space in which each term or document is represented as a vector in the space. It not only greatly reduces the dimensionality but also discovers the important associative relationship between terms. Because of the too much calculation time of constructing a new semantic space, in this algorithm, firstly we apply a kind of feature selection method to reduce the term dimensions. Secondly, we construct a new reduced semantic space between terms based on latent semantic indexing method. Through some applications involving spam database categorization, we find that our two-stage feature selection method performs better.

Then the SO of the given blog text is determined by the max mutual information value. A blog text is classified as joy if the SO of its phrases is joy. Two different corpora are adopted to test our method, one is the Blog corpus collected by Monitor and Research Center for National Language Resource Network Multimedia Sub-branch Center, and the other is Chinese dataset provided by COAE2008 task. Based on the two datasets, the method respectively achieves a high improvement compared to the traditional methods.

16344;"Theory of K-representations as a comprehensive formal framework for developing a multilingual semantic web";0;"Fomichov, V.A.";"A comprehensive theoretical framework for the development of a Semantic Web of a new generation, or of a Multilingual Semantic Web, is outlined. Firstly, the paper grounds the possibility of using a mathematical model being the kernel of the theory of K-representations and describing a system of 10 partial operations on conceptual structures for building semantic representations (or text meaning representations) of, likely, arbitrary sentences and discourses in English, Russian, French, German, and other languages. The possibilities of using SK-languages defined by the theory of K-representations for building semantic annotations of informational sources and for constructing semantic representations of discourses pertaining to biology and medicine are illustrated. Secondly, an original strategy of transforming the existing Web into a Semantic Web of a new generation with the well-developed mechanisms of understanding natural language texts is described. The third subject of this paper is a description of the correspondence between the inputs and outputs of the elaborated algorithm of semantic-syntactic analysis and of its advantages; the semantic representations of the input texts are the expressions of SK-languages (standard knowledge languages).

16345;"A new factor for computing the relevance of a document to a query";0;"Boughanem, M. and Mallak, I. and Prade, H.";"In this paper we propose a method for semantic text representation and term weighting. It is based on a semantic resource, WordNet, that provides meaning information and relations between the terms of a document. The heart of the proposed method is the way the concepts (terms) of documents are clustered and weighted. More precisely, we introduce two notions: the ""centrality"" of a term and its specificity. The centrality of a term is given by the number of terms of the document that are directly related to it in the same conceptual cluster. The ""specificity"" represents the depth of a concept in WordNet. These parameters are different from the usual term frequency ""tf"" and inverse term frequency ""idf"" used in classical information retrieval. This method is based on two steps: 1) matching document terms with concepts of ""WordNet"" in order to obtain the most appropriate ones 2) for each concept calculating its centrality using existing semantic ""WordNet"" relations, and its ""specificity"".

16346;"Semantic Hierarchical Document Signature for determining sentence similarity";0;"Manna, S. and Gedeon, T.";"In this paper, we present a new approach that incorporates semantic information from a document, in the form of Hierarchical Document Signature (HDS), to measure semantic similarity between sentences. Due to variability of expressions of natural language, it is very essential to exploit the semantic properties of a document to accurately identify semantically similar sentences since sentences conveying the same fact or concept may be composed lexically and syntactically different. Inversely, sentences which are lexically common may not necessarily convey the same meaning. This poses a significant impact on many text mining applications performance where sentence-level judgment is involved. Our HDS uses the natural hierarchy of the document and represents it in a modularized form of document level to sentence level, sentence to word level; aggregating similarity components at the lower levels and propagating them to the next higher level to produce the final similarity between sentences. The evaluation of our HDS model has shown that it resembles the decision making process as done by human to a greater extent than different vector space models which only uses bag of words concept.

16353;"Correlation analysis of visual verbs subcategorization based on Pearsons correlation coefficient";0;"Wu, W.-J.a  and Xu, Y.b ";"In the research of modern linguistics, word frame information, which is significant in the study of Chinese information processing, draws more researchers attention. Its distinction between word argument and auxiliaries plays an important part in the precision of syntactic analysis, elimination of semantic ambiguities and semantic role labeling. Therefore, the study of categorization frame information became a hot issue in the recent years. With the constant development of machine learning technology, an increasing number of computational methods have been applied to many fields, including text classification, language processing and semantic analysis, etc. This approach is the supplement and breakthrough to the traditional methods of linguistic study. In this paper, Pearsons correlation coefficient, which can reflect the correlative information between two variables, is adopted to analyze the correlation between the frequency and functions of Chinese visual verbs. The result is that word frequency takes on positive correlations with the main functions of the word, though with certain differences in the degree of the correlation.

So the depth and accuracy of mining are not satisfying. In order to solve this problem, a novel ontology-based semantic association pattern mining model is proposed. The suggested model applies semantic role labeling to semantic analysis so that the semantic relations are able to be extracted precisely. For the defects of traditional association pattern mining algorithms that could not effectively deal with semantic metabase, a novel semantic-based association pattern mining algorithm is designed for the acquisition of the deep semantic association patterns from semantic metabase. Experimental results reveal that the new model can acquire deep semantic knowledge easily from text database and the algorithm mentioned above has strong adaptability and scalability.

A key limitation of current bRE systems is that they are restricted by the availability of annotated corpora. In this work we introduce a semi-supervised approach that can tackle multi-level bRE via string comparisons with mismatches in the string kernel framework. Our string kernel implements an abstraction step, which groups similar words to generate more abstract entities, which can be learnt with unlabeled data. Specifically, two unsupervised models are proposed to capture contextual (local or global) semantic similarities between words from a large unannotated corpus. This Abstraction-augmented String Kernel (ASK) allows for better generalization of patterns learned from annotated data and provides a unified framework for solving bRE with multiple degrees of detail. ASK shows effective improvements over classic string kernels on four datasets and achieves state-of-the-art bRE performance without the need for complex linguistic features.

Current approaches are mostly surface-oriented (or use only shallow syntactic representations) and see each text only as a token list. In this work however, we describe a deep, semantically oriented method based on semantic networks which are derived by a syntactico-semantic parser. Semantically identical or similar semantic networks for each sentence of a given base text are efficiently retrieved by using a specialized index. In order to detect many kinds of paraphrases the semantic networks of a candidate text are varied by applying inferences: lexico-semantic relations, relation axioms, and meaning postulates. Important phenomena occurring in difficult duplicates are discussed. The deep approach profits from background knowledge, whose acquisition from corpora is explained briefly. The deep duplicate recognizer is combined with two shallow duplicate recognizers in order to guarantee a high recall for texts which are not fully parsable. The evaluation shows that the combined approach preserves recall and increases precision considerably in comparison to traditional shallow methods.

Many surveyors from shipping companies are working in shipyards to improve the quality and to meet requirements of the ship owner. At present, the reports from surveyors are used only for managing the status of problems of the product. The proposed method here has three steps. First, the description field of the reports which contains information about some trouble is summarized in a pair of a component name and a trouble name in the failure database; this is made possible through text-processing technology. Second, synonymous component and trouble names are consolidated into normalized terms using synonym ontology to prepare this information for statistical analysis. The synonym ontology is developed prior to this procedure. The system evaluates frequent trouble records by classifying the records using component and process ontology. In the last step, the designers extract knowledge from the information generated by the system. The results illustrate common design problems, and the method is proved to be useful.

16365;"An integration of WordNet and fuzzy association rule mining for multi-label document clustering";0;"Chen, C.-L.a  and Tseng, F.S.C.b  c  and Liang, T.a ";"With the rapid growth of text documents, document clustering has become one of the main techniques for organizing large amount of documents into a small number of meaningful clusters. However, there still exist several challenges for document clustering, such as high dimensionality, scalability, accuracy, meaningful cluster labels, overlapping clusters, and extracting semantics from texts. In order to improve the quality of document clustering results, we propose an effective Fuzzy-based Multi-label Document Clustering (FMDC) approach that integrates fuzzy association rule mining with an existing ontology WordNet to alleviate these problems. In our approach, the key terms will be extracted from the document set, and the initial representation of all documents is further enriched by using hypernyms of WordNet in order to exploit the semantic relations between terms. Then, a fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for texts is employed to discover a set of highly-related fuzzy frequent itemsets, which contain key terms to be regarded as the labels of the candidate clusters. Finally, each document is dispatched into more than one target cluster by referring to these candidate clusters, and then the highly similar target clusters are merged. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance based on Classic, Re0, R8, and WebKB datasets. The experimental results proved that our approach outperforms the influential document clustering methods with higher accuracy. Therefore, our approach not only provides more general and meaningful labels for documents, but also effectively generates overlapping clusters. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

16368;"A community mining algorithm for web texts based on Multi-agent system";0;"Yang, H.a  b  and Wang, Z.a  b  and Zhou, X.a  and Zhou, T.a  b  and Wang, Z.a  b ";"Most of the existing methods for community discovery only deal with social network with a fixed structure, so they can not effectively deal with dynamic social network. This paper proposes a Multi-agent system method which is applied to real-time dynamic web texts for community discovery. This method combines the multi-agent system control mechanisms with community discovery algorithm. The approach not only divides community for the published web text, but also changes the community division according to the newly updated contents of web texts. Meanwhile, the similarity of two web texts is evaluated through similarity algorithm which compares content similarity and semantic similarity. The effectiveness of this algorithm has been tested on real web texts networks and experiment 3 illustrated the scalability of our algorithm for dynamic community discovery of web texts.

Based on the idea of ""Service Distributed and Management Centralized"", this paper proposes a cloud architecture for psychological health analysis and describes the service component representation, workflow customization and workflow execution. With the excellent semantic representation ability of resource description frame (RDF), a service component metadata representation method is presented. Through querying the metadata of service component, end-users could choose the service components and customize the logic workflow on demand. In the workflow execution, the workflow case database is constructed. Through analyzing the similarity between history case and user workflow, a series of workflow reuse strategies are proposed. To validate the performance of the cloud architecture for psychological health analysis, a set of experiments are prepared to test the viability, the results demonstrate that the cloud architecture has higher precision, reuse and scalability for psychological health analysis of web text.

16379;"Applying latent semantic analysis to classify emotions in Thai text";0;"Inrak, P. and Sinthupinyo, S.";"With a rapid growth of the internet communication, many types of text are produced. They can convey the meanings that can contribute to text categorization. Emotion classification also becomes more interesting, but emotion classification in Thai text is still not able to be correctly classified. Thus, this paper proposes a novel approach that takes advantage of bi-words occurrence to classify emotion hidden in a short sentence. In this paper, we classify Thai text into six basic universal emotions including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise based on latent semantic analysis approach. We compared the results between two models which construct features from the sentences and applied to three classification methods, i.e. Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree. The first feature model uses only single word occurrence in the classification. The second model uses single word combined with bi-words occurrence in the classification. The results show that the second model can yield higher accuracy than the first model based on the NaÃ¯ve Bayes classification method.

BA is typically performed to define and validate solutions that are designed to meet organizations business needs, goals or objectives.

In this paper we demonstrate how constructing semantic ontologies can increase the level of automation of BA methods and techniques. This can be achieved by sophisticated semantic data analysis that can help us structure information and obtain birds-eye overview of a given domain. For the case study we take a set of abstracts from the articles presented on CompSysTech09 conference and use OntoGen tool to semi-automatically construct ontology for the domain. The obtained results indicate that the proposed approach can be effectively used to digest textual information and present it in a more operational form of topic ontology.

16392;"Semantic drift in ontologies";0;"Gulla, J.A.a  and Solskinnsbakk, G.a  and Myrseth, P.b  and Haderlein, V.b  and Cerrato, O.b ";"Ontology evolution is the process of incrementally and consistently adapting an existing ontology to changes in the relevant domain. Even though ontology management and versioning tools are now available, they are of limited use for ontology evolution unless the desired changes are known beforehand. Ontology learning toolsets are often employed, but they require large document sets and do not take the existing structures into account. Semantic drift refers to how concepts intentions gradually change as the domain evolves. When a semantic drift is detected, it means that a concept is gradually understood in a different way or its relationships with other concepts are undergoing some changes. A semantic drift captures small domain changes that are hard to detect with traditional ontology engineering approaches. This paper discusses a new approach to detecting and assessing semantic drift in ontologies. The method makes use of concept signatures that are constructed on the basis of how concepts are used and described. Comparing how signatures change over time, we see how concepts semantic content evolves and how their relationships to other concepts gradually reflect these changes. An experiment with the DNVs business sector ontology from 2004 and 2008 demonstrates the value of this approach to ontology evolution.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"VERY_LOW";15;"2010";"WEBIST 2010 - Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technology";;"Conference Paper";"Trata-se de evolução de ontologias.";"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77956272836&partnerID=40&md5=a289925d1d9026fa9830a912f1addfa3";"2";"13-20";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"11/08/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"evolucao de topicos";"null";"null";"null";"null";"geracao automatica de ontologia";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

Automatic extraction techniques have to be able to identify different versions of the same relation which usually may be expressed in a great variety of ways. Therefore these techniques benefit from taking into account many syntactic and semantic features, especially parse trees generated by automatic sentence parsers. Typed dependency parse trees are edge and node labeled parse trees whose labels and topology contains valuable semantic clues. This information can be exploited for relation extraction by the use of kernels over structured data for classification. In this paper we present new tree kernels for relation extraction over typed dependency parse trees.

For the entities like, protein, gene and disease, we determine whether the statement refers to biomarker relationship (i.e., assertion classification). Finally, we identify the biomarker relationship among the biomedical entities (i.e., semantic relationship classification). The system, Biomarker Information Extraction Tool (BIET) implements Machine Learning-based biomarker extraction using support vector machines (SVM). The system is trained and tested on a corpus of oncology related PubMed/MEDLINE literatures hand-annotated with biomarker information. We investigate the effectiveness of different features for this task and examine the amount of training data needed to learn the biomarker relationship with the entities.

It assumes that computational humor is an useful task for any number of reasons and in many applications. Besides these applications, it also shows that recognition of humor is a perfect test platform for an advanced level of language understanding by a computer. It discusses the computational linguistic/semantic preconditions for computational humor and an ontological semantic approach to the task of humor detection, based on direct and comprehensive access to meaning rather than on trying to guess it with statistical-cum-syntactical keyword methods. The paper is informed by the experience of designing and implementing a humor detection model, whose decent success rate confirmed some of the assumptions while its flaws made other ideas prominent, including the necessity of full text comprehension. The bulk of the paper explains how the comprehensive meaning access technology makes it possible for unstructured natural language text to be automatically translated into the ontologically defined text meaning representations that can be used then to detect humor in them, if any, automatically. This part is informed by the experience, subsequent to humor detection, of designing, implementing, and testing an ontological semantic text analyzer that takes an English sentence as input and outputs its text meaning representation (TMR). Every procedure mentioned in the paper has either been implemented or proven to be implementable within the approach.

16402;"An efficient concept-based mining model for enhancing text clustering";0;"Shehata, S.a  and Karray, F.b  and Kamel, M.b ";"Most of the common techniques in text mining are based on the statistical analysis of a term, either word or phrase. Statistical analysis of a term frequency captures the importance of the term within a document only. However, two terms can have the same frequency in their documents, but one term contributes more to the meaning of its sentences than the other term. Thus, the underlying text mining model should indicate terms that capture the semantics of text. In this case, the mining model can capture terms that present the concepts of the sentence, which leads to discovery of the topic of the document. A new concept-based mining model that analyzes terms on the sentence, document, and corpus levels is introduced. The concept-based mining model can effectively discriminate between nonimportant terms with respect to sentence semantics and terms which hold the concepts that represent the sentence meaning. The proposed mining model consists of sentence-based concept analysis, document-based concept analysis, corpus-based concept-analysis, and concept-based similarity measure. The term which contributes to the sentence semantics is analyzed on the sentence, document, and corpus levels rather than the traditional analysis of the document only. The proposed model can efficiently find significant matching concepts between documents, according to the semantics of their sentences. The similarity between documents is calculated based on a new concept-based similarity measure. The proposed similarity measure takes full advantage of using the concept analysis measures on the sentence, document, and corpus levels in calculating the similarity between documents. Large sets of experiments using the proposed concept-based mining model on different data sets in text clustering are conducted. The experiments demonstrate extensive comparison between the concept-based analysis and the traditional analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial enhancement of the clustering quality using the sentence-based, document-based, corpus-based, and combined approach concept analysis.

16404;"Domain concept handling in automated text categorization";0;"Liu, Y.a  and Loh, H.T.b ";"Single term based document representations, e.g. bag- of-words, have been widely accepted in the machine learning, information retrieval and text mining community. One notable limitation of such methods is that they do not consider the rich information resident in the semantic relations among terms. This paper reports our approach of concepts handling in document representation and its effect on the performance of text categorization. We introduce a Frequent word Sequence algorithm that generates concept-centered phrases to render domain knowledge concepts. Our experimental study based on a domain centered corpus shows that a consistent performance improvement can be achieved when concept-centered phrases are included in addition to the single term based features in document representations. We also observed that a universally suitable support threshold does not exist and the removal of concept irrelevant sequences can possibly further improve the performance at a lower support level.

16405;"Use of domain knowledge in the automatic extraction of structured representations from patient-related texts";0;"Angelova, G.";"Domain knowledge is essential resource in Information Extraction (IE) from free text since it supports the decisions about structuring the extracted text objects into domain statements. Thus manually-created conceptual structures enable the semantic representation of textual information.

The article shows that domain knowledge is encoded not only in the conceptual structures, which provide the ontological framework for the IE task, but also in the IE templates that are designed to capture domain semantics. A prototype system and IE examples of domain knowledge usage are considered together with results of the current prototype evaluation.

However, textual information is acquiring an increasing importance with the appearance of methods for textual data mining. This paper proposes the use of classical clustering algorithms with a mixed function that combines numerical, categorical and semantic features. The content of the semantic features is extracted from textual data. This paper analyses and compares the behavior of different existing semantic similarity functions that use WordNet as background ontology. The different partitions obtained with the clustering algorithm are compared to human classifications in order to see which one approximates better the human reasoning. Moreover, the interpretability of the obtained clusters is discussed. The results show that those similarity measures that provide better results when compared using a standard benchmark also provide better and more interpretable partitions.

The main contributions of our work are two-fold: First, given the usual structure of a news story, we propose a novel algorithm to extract topic sentences by stressing the importance of news headline; Second, we extract event facts (i.e. 5W1H) from these topic sentences by applying a rule-based method (verb-driven) and a supervised machine-learning method (SVM). This method significantly improves the predicate-argument structure used in Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) Event Extraction (EE) task by considering valency (dominant capacity to noun phrases) of a Chinese verb. Extensive experiments on ACE 2005 datasets confirm its effectiveness and it also shows a very high scalability, since we only consider the topic sentences and surface text features. Based on this method, we build a prototype system named Chinese News Fact Extractor (CNFE). CNFE is evaluated on a real world corpus containing 30,000 newspaper documents. Experiment results show that CNFE can extract event facts efficiently.

However, few of them take the strength of user sentiments into consideration, which is particularly important in measuring the overall quality of products/services. Intuitively, different reviews for the same feature should have quite different sentiment strength, even though they may express the same polarity of sentiment. This paper presents an approach to estimating the sentiment strength of user reviews according to the strength of adverbs and adjectives expressed by users in their opinion phrases. Experimental result on a hotel review dataset in Chinese shows that the proposed approach is effective in the task of sentiment classification and achieves a good performance on a multi-scale evaluation.

16421;"Entity refinement using latent semantic indexing";0;"Bradford, R.B.";"Automated extraction of named entities is an important text analysis task. In addition to recognizing the occurrence of entity names, it is important to be able to label those names by type. Most entity extraction techniques categorize extracted entities into a few basic types, such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION. This paper presents an approach for generating more fine-grained subdivisions of entity type. The technique of latent semantic indexing (LSI) is used to provide semantic context as an indicator of likely entity subtype. Tests were carried out on a collection of 5.5 million English-language news articles. At modest levels of recall, the accuracy of sub-type assignment was comparable to the accuracy with which the gross type was assigned by a state-of-the-art commercial entity extraction software package.

16423;"Expression microarray classification using topic models";0;"Bicego, M.a  b  and Lovato, P.a  and Oliboni, B.a  and Perina, A.a ";"Classification of samples in expression microarray experiments represents a crucial task in bioinformatics and biomedicine. In this paper this scenario is addressed by employing a particular class of statistical approaches, called Topic Models. These models, firstly introduced in the text mining community, permit to extract from a set of objects (typically documents) an interpretable and rich description, based on an intermediate representation called topics (or processes). In this paper the expression microarray classification task is cast into this probabilistic context, providing a parallelism with the text mining domain and an interpretation. Two different topic models are investigated, namely the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). An experimental evaluation of the proposed methodologies on three standard datasets confirms their effectiveness, also in comparison with other classification methodologies.

16424;"Hypothesis generation and ranking based on event similarities";0;"Miyanishi, T.a  and Seki, K.b  and Uehara, K.a ";"Accelerated by the technological advances in the domain, the size of the biomedical literature has been growing rapidly. As a result, it is not feasible for individual researchers to comprehend and synthesize all the information related to their interests. Therefore, it is conceivable to discover hidden knowledge, or hypotheses, by linking fragments of information independently described in the literature. In fact, such hypotheses have been reported in the literature mining community; some of which have even been corroborated by experiments. This paper mainly focuses on hypothesis ranking and investigates an approach to identifying reasonable ones based on semantic similarities between events which lead to respective hypotheses. Our assumption is that hypotheses generated from semantically similar events are more reasonable. The validity of our approach is demonstrated in comparison with those based on term frequencies, often adopted in the related work.

16431;"Collaborative semantic points of interests";0;"Braun, M. and Scherp, A. and Staab, S.";"The novel mobile application csxPOI (short for: collaborative, semantic, and context-aware points-of-interest) enables its users to collaboratively create, share, and modify semantic points of interest (POI). Semantic POIs describe geographic places with explicit semantic properties of a collaboratively created ontology. As the ontology includes multiple subclassifications and instantiations and as it links to DBpedia, the richness of annotation goes far beyond mere textual annotations such as tags. Users can search for POIs through the subclass hierarchy of the collaboratively created ontology. For example, a POI annotated as bakery can be found through the search string shop as it is a superclass of bakery. Data mining techniques are employed to cluster and thus improve the quality of the collaboratively created POIs.

16433;"Context-driven semantic enrichment of Italian news archive";0;"Tamilin, A. and Magnini, B. and Serafini, L. and Girardi, C. and Joseph, M. and Zanoli, R.";"Semantic enrichment of textual data is the operation of linking mentions with the entities they refer to, and the subsequent enrichment of such entities with the background knowledge about them available in one or more knowledge bases (or in the entire web). Information about the context in which a mention occurs, (e.g., information about the time, the topic, and the space, which the text is relative to) constitutes a critical resource for a correct semantic enrichment for two reasons. First, without context, mentions are ""too little text"" to unambiguously refer to a single entity. Second, knowledge about entities is also context dependent (e.g., speaking about political life of Illinois during 1996, Obama is a Senator, while since 2009, Obama is the US president). In this paper, we describe a concrete approach to context-driven semantic enrichment, built upon four core sub-tasks: detection of mentions in text (i.e., finding references to people, locations and organizations); determination of the context of discourses of the text, identification of the referred entities in the knowledge base, and enrichment of the entity with the knowledge relevant to the context. In such approach, context-driven semantic enrichment needs also to have contextualized background knowledge. To cope with this aspect, we propose a customization of Sesame, one of state-of-the-art knowledge repositories, to support representation and reasoning with contextualized knowledge. The approach has been fully implemented in a system, which has been practically deployed and applied to the textual archive of the local Italian newspaper ""LAdige"", covering the decade of years from 1999 to 2009.

The extraction is based on the unsupervised analysis of text corpora. We contrast ICA with singular value decomposition (SVD), widely used in statistical text analysis, in general, and specifically in latent semantic analysis (LSA). However, the representations found using the SVD analysis cannot easily be interpreted by humans. In contrast, ICA applied on word context data gives distinct features which reflect linguistic categories. In this paper, we provide justification for our approach called WordICA, present the WordICA method in detail, compare the obtained results with traditional linguistic categories and with the results achieved using an SVD-based method, and discuss the use of the method in practical natural language engineering solutions such as machine translation systems. As the WordICA method is based on unsupervised learning and thus provides a general means for efficient knowledge acquisition, we foresee that the approach has a clear potential for practical applications.

16460;"Self-organising map for document categorization using latent semantic analysis";0;"Mahalakshmi, B. and Duraiswamy, K.";"With the increasing amount of unstructured content available electronically on the web, content categorization becomes very important for efficient information retrieval. The basic approaches for information retrieval in text documents are searching using keywords, categorization of the documents and filtering out the stream. To extract information from raw data, its complexity needed to be first reduced. Clustering methods and Projection methods are aimed at reducing the amount of data and dimensionality of data respectively. SOM is a special case in that it can be used at the same time for both clustering and projection. It projects onto a 2D-grid. Various methods were developed for the automatic clustering of worldwide web documents according to the user requirements. The objective of this paper is to reduce the time and effort the user has to find the information sought after. The method termed topologica organization of content can generate classified topics from a se of unstructured documents. The TOC is a set of hierarchicall organized 1D-growing SOMs. In TOC, vector space model is used for indexing of 1D-SOM. In the proposed approach, latent semantic indexing of 1D-SOM can be used to enhance the association between terms. Latent semantic analysis is a technique that projects the original high dimensional document vector into a space with latent semantic dimensions. A term-bydocument matrix is constructed for the information retrieval. A brief review is given on existing methods for documents clustering and organization. The proposed method which can use LSI will be efficient in terms of computational cost, accuracy and visualization. It can be easily adapted for large data set.

To effectively reduce these incidents, it is vital to accurately identify why these incidents occurred. More precisely, given a set of possible causes, or shaping factors, this task of cause identification involves identifying all and only those shaping factors that are responsible for the incidents described in a report. We investigate two approaches to cause identification. Both approaches exploit information provided by a semantic lexicon, which is automatically constructed via Thelen and Riloffs Basilisk framework augmented with our linguistic and algorithmic modifications. The first approach labels a report using a simple heuristic, which looks for the words and phrases acquired during the semantic lexicon learning process in the report. The second approach recasts cause identification as a text classification problem, employing supervised and transductive text classification algorithms to learn models from incident reports labeled with shaping factors and using the models to label unseen reports.

16466;"Geographical classification of documents using evidence from Wikipedia";0;"Odon De Alencar, R. and Davis Jr., C.A. and GonÃ§alves, M.A.";"Obtaining or approximating a geographic location for search results often motivates users to include place names and other geography-related terms in their queries. Previous work shows that queries that include geography-related terms correspond to a significant share of the users demand. Therefore, it is important to recognize the association of documents to places in order to adequately respond to such queries. This paper describes strategies for text classification into geography-related categories, using evidence extracted from Wikipedia. We use terms that correspond to entry titles and the connections between entries in Wikipedias graph to establish a semantic network from which classification features are generated. Results of experiments using a news data-set, classified over Brazilian states, show that such terms constitute valid evidence for the geographical classification of documents, and demonstrate the potential of this technique for text classification.

16469;"Reflective Random Indexing and indirect inference: A scalable method for discovery of implicit connections";0;"Cohen, T.a  and Schvaneveldt, R.b  and Widdows, D.c ";"The discovery of implicit connections between terms that do not occur together in any scientific document underlies the model of literature-based knowledge discovery first proposed by Swanson. Corpus-derived statistical models of semantic distance such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) have been evaluated previously as methods for the discovery of such implicit connections. However, LSA in particular is dependent on a computationally demanding method of dimension reduction as a means to obtain meaningful indirect inference, limiting its ability to scale to large text corpora. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Random Indexing (RI), a scalable distributional model of word associations, to draw meaningful implicit relationships between terms in general and biomedical language. Proponents of this method have achieved comparable performance to LSA on several cognitive tasks while using a simpler and less computationally demanding method of dimension reduction than LSA employs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the original implementation of RI is ineffective at inferring meaningful indirect connections, and evaluate Reflective Random Indexing (RRI), an iterative variant of the method that is better able to perform indirect inference. RRI is shown to lead to more clearly related indirect connections and to outperform existing RI implementations in the prediction of future direct co-occurrence in the MEDLINE corpus.

16472;"Beyond genes, proteins, and abstracts: Identifying scientific claims from full-text biomedical articles";0;"Blake, C.";"Massive increases in electronically available text have spurred a variety of natural language processing methods to automatically identify relationships from text; however, existing annotated collections comprise only bioinformatics (gene-protein) or clinical informatics (treatment-disease) relationships. This paper introduces the Claim Framework that reflects how authors across biomedical spectrum communicate findings in empirical studies. The Framework captures different levels of evidence by differentiating between explicit and implicit claims, and by capturing under-specified claims such as correlations, comparisons, and observations. The results from 29 full-text articles show that authors report fewer than 7.84% of scientific claims in an abstract, thus revealing the urgent need for text mining systems to consider the full-text of an article rather than just the abstract. The results also show that authors typically report explicit claims (77.12%) rather than an observations (9.23%), correlations (5.39%), comparisons (5.11%) or implicit claims (2.7%). Informed by the initial manual annotations, we introduce an automated approach that uses syntax and semantics to identify explicit claims automatically and measure the degree to which each feature contributes to the overall precision and recall. Results show that a combination of semantics and syntax is required to achieve the best system performance. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

16475;"Implementing query answering for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases";0;"Gomes, A.S. and Alferes, J.J. and Swift, T.";"Ontologies and rules are usually loosely coupled in knowledge representation formalisms. In fact, ontologies use open-world reasoning while the leading semantics for rules use non-monotonic, closed-world reasoning. One exception is the tightly-coupled framework of Minimal Knowledge and Negation as Failure (MKNF), which allows statements about individuals to be jointly derived via entailment from an ontology and inferences from rules. Nonetheless, the practical usefulness of MKNF has not always been clear, although recent work has formalized a general resolution-based method for querying MKNF when rules are taken to have the well-founded semantics, and the ontology is modeled by a general Oracle. That work leaves open what algorithms should be used to relate the entailments of the ontology and the inferences of rules. In this paper we provide such algorithms, and describe the implementation of a query-driven system, CDF-Rules, for hybrid knowledge bases combining both (non-monotonic) rules under the well-founded semantics and a (monotonic) ontology, represented by a CDF (ALCQ) theory.

16477;"Improving document clustering in a learned concept space";0;"Pessiot, J.-F.a  and Kim, Y.-M.a  and Amini, M.R.a  b  and Gallinari, P.a ";"Most document clustering algorithms operate in a high dimensional bag-of-words space. The inherent presence of noise in such representation obviously degrades the performance of most of these approaches. In this paper we investigate an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique for document clustering. This technique is based upon the assumption that terms co-occurring in the same context with the same frequencies are semantically related. On the basis of this assumption we first find term clusters using a classification version of the EM algorithm. Documents are then represented in the space of these term clusters and a multinomial mixture model (MM) is used to build document clusters. We empirically show on four document collections, Reuters-21578, Reuters RCV2-French, 20Newsgroups and WebKB, that this new text representation noticeably increases the performance of the MM model. By relating the proposed approach to the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model we further propose an extension of the latter in which an extra latent variable allows the model to co-cluster documents and terms simultaneously. We show on these four datasets that the proposed extended version of the PLSA model produces statistically significant improvements with respect to two clustering measures over all variants of the original PLSA and the MM models.

16478;"Automatic text categorization based on content analysis with cognitive situation models";0;"Guo, Y.a  b  and Shao, Z.a  and Hua, N.c ";"Text categorization is an important research area of text mining. The original purpose of text categorization is to recognize, understand and organize different types of texts or documents. The general categorization approaches are treated as supervised learning, which infers similarity among a collection of categorized texts for training purposes. The existing categorization approaches are obviously not content-oriented and constrained at single word level. This paper introduces an innovative content-oriented text categorization approach named as CogCate. Inspired by cognitive situation models, CogCate exploits a human cognitive procedure in categorizing texts. In addition to traditional statistical analysis at word level, CogCate also applies lexical/semantical analysis, which ensures the accuracy of categorization. The evaluation experiments have testified the performance of CogCate. Meanwhile, CogCate remarkably reduces the time and effort spent on software training and maintenance of text collections. Our research work attests that interdisciplinary research efforts benefit text categorization. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The results of the term context recognition are used to assess term frequencies of terms, and hence CTFA may easily work with various kinds of text classifiers that base their TC decisions on term frequencies, without needing to modify the classifiers. Moreover, CTFA is efficient, and neither huge memory nor domain specific knowledge is required. Empirical results show that CTFA successfully enhances performance of several kinds of text classifiers on different experimental data.

Especially models with latent variables have proved to be effective in capturing hidden structures in the data. In this paper, we survey an important subclass Directed Probabilistic Topic Models (DPTMs) with soft clustering abilities and their applications for knowledge discovery in text corpora. From an unsupervised learning perspective, ""topics are semantically related probabilistic clusters of words in text corpora; and the process for finding these topics is called topic modeling"". In topic modeling, a document consists of different hidden topics and the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document to smooth data from the semantic level. It has been an active area of research during the last decade. Many models have been proposed for handling the problems of modeling text corpora with different characteristics, for applications such as document classification, hidden association finding, expert finding, community discovery and temporal trend analysis. We give basic concepts, advantages and disadvantages in a chronological order, existing models classification into different categories, their parameter estimation and inference making algorithms with models performance evaluation measures.

16489;"Knowledge-based vector space model for text clustering";0;"Jing, L.a  and Ng, M.K.b  and Huang, J.Z.c ";"This paper presents a new knowledge-based vector space model (VSM) for text clustering. In the new model, semantic relationships between terms (e.g., words or concepts) are included in representing text documents as a set of vectors. The idea is to calculate the dissimilarity between two documents more effectively so that text clustering results can be enhanced. In this paper, the semantic relationship between two terms is defined by the similarity of the two terms. Such similarity is used to re-weight term frequency in the VSM. We consider and study two different similarity measures for computing the semantic relationship between two terms based on two different approaches. The first approach is based on the existing ontologies like WordNet and MeSH. We define a new similarity measure that combines the edge-counting technique, the average distance and the position weighting method to compute the similarity of two terms from an ontology hierarchy. The second approach is to make use of text corpora to construct the relationships between terms and then calculate their semantic similarities. Three clustering algorithms, bisecting k-means, feature weighting k-means and a hierarchical clustering algorithm, have been used to cluster real-world text data represented in the new knowledge-based VSM. The experimental results show that the clustering performance based on the new model was much better than that based on the traditional term-based VSM.

16491;"CRCTOL: A semantic-based domain ontology learning system";0;"Jiang, X. and Tan, A.-H.";"Domain ontologies play an important role in supporting knowledge-based applications in the Semantic Web. To facilitate the building of ontologies, text mining techniques have been used to perform ontology learning from texts. However, traditional systems employ shallow natural language processing techniques and focus only on concept and taxonomic relation extraction. In this paper we present a system, known as Concept-Relation-Concept Tuple-based Ontology Learning (CRCTOL), for mining ontologies automatically from domain-specific documents. Specifically, CRCTOL adopts a full text parsing technique and employs a combination of statistical and lexico-syntactic methods, including a statistical algorithm that extracts key concepts from a document collection, a word sense disambiguation algorithm that disambiguates words in the key concepts, a rule-based algorithm that extracts relations between the key concepts, and a modified generalized association rule mining algorithm that prunes unimportant relations for ontology learning. As a result, the ontologies learned by CRCTOL are more concise and contain a richer semantics in terms of the range and number of semantic relations compared with alternative systems. We present two case studies where CRCTOL is used to build a terrorism domain ontology and a sport event domain ontology. At the component level, quantitative evaluation by comparing with Text-To-Onto and its successor Text2Onto has shown that CRCTOL is able to extract concepts and semantic relations with a significantly higher level of accuracy. At the ontology level, the quality of the learned ontologies is evaluated by either employing a set of quantitative and qualitative methods including analyzing the graph structural property, comparison to WordNet, and expert rating, or directly comparing with a human-edited benchmark ontology, demonstrating the high quality of the ontologies learned.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";27;"2010";"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology";;"Article";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72849148903&partnerID=40&md5=2ccd646408bb0de5df60d1581ee2f794";"61";"150-168";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"29/07/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"geracao automatica de ontologia, regras de associacao";"null";"null";"null";"null";"seguranca, esportes";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"
16493;"Text relatedness based on aword thesaurus";0;"Tsatsaronis, G.a  and Varlamis, I.b  and Vazirgiannis, M.c ";"The computation of relatedness between two fragments of text in an automated manner requires taking into account a wide range of factors pertaining to the meaning the two fragments convey, and the pairwise relations between their words. Without doubt, a measure of relatedness between text segments must take into account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words. Such a measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many tasks, such as text retrieval, classification and clustering. In this paper we present a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words based on their implicit semantic links. The approach exploits only a word thesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words. Based on this approach, we introduce Omiotis, a new measure of semantic relatedness between texts which capitalizes on the word-to-word semantic relatedness measure (SR) and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts. We gradually validate our method: we first evaluate the performance of the semantic relatedness measure between individual words, covering word-to-word similarity and relatedness, synonym identification and word analogy; then, we proceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring text-to-text semantic relatedness in two tasks, namely sentence-to-sentence similarity and paraphrase recognition. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms every lexicon-based method of semantic relatedness in the selected tasks and the used data sets, and competes well against corpus-based and hybrid approaches.

16494;"Recognizing textual entailment: Rational, evaluation and approaches";0;"Dagan, I.a  and Dolan, B.b  and Magnini, B.c  and Roth, D.d ";"The goal of identifying textual entailment ? whether one piece of text can be plausibly inferred from another ? has emerged in recent years as a generic core problem in natural language understanding. Work in this area has been largely driven by the PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges, which are a series of annual competitive meetings. The current work exhibits strong ties to some earlier lines of research, particularly automatic acquisition of paraphrases and lexical semantic relationships and unsupervised inference in applications such as question answering, information extraction and summarization. It has also opened the way to newer lines of research on more involved inference methods, on knowledge representations needed to support this natural language understanding challenge and on the use of learning methods in this context. RTE has fostered an active and growing community of researchers focused on the problem of applied entailment. This special issue of the JNLE provides an opportunity to showcase some of the most important work in this emerging area.

16496;"A statistical approach for semantic relation extraction";0;"Imsombut, A.";"Semantic relations are an important component of ontologies that can support many applications e.g. text mining, question answering, and information extraction. Automatic semantic relation extraction system is a crucial tool that can reduce the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition in the ontologies construction. In this paper, we present a statistical approach for learning the semantic relations between concepts of an ontology in the agricultural domain. The semantic relations are acquired by using verbs to indicate the relations between ontology concepts. The co-occurrences of domain verbs with their components, which are annotated the concepts, are analyzed by using several statistical methodologies. Moreover, we expand the sets of verb expressing the same semantic relation by using the extracted patterns of concept pairs of the seed verbs component. Our experiment has been done on a collection of Thai shallow parsed texts in the domain of agriculture. The precision and recall of the presented system is 65% and 82%, respectively.

16499;"Dissimilarity algorithm on conceptual graphs to mine text outliers";0;"Kamaruddin, S.S. and Hamdan, A.R. and Bakar, A.A. and Nor, F.M.";"The graphical text representation method such as Conceptual Graphs (CGs) attempts to capture the structure and semantics of documents. As such, they are the preferred text representation approach for a wide range of problems namely in natural language processing, information retrieval and text mining. In a number of these applications, it is necessary to measure the dissimilarity (or similarity) between knowledge represented in the CGs. In this paper, we would like to present a dissimilarity algorithm to detect outliers from a collection of text represented with Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF). In order to avoid the NP-complete problem of graph matching algorithm, we introduce the use of a standard CG in the dissimilarity computation. We evaluate our method in the context of analyzing real world financial statements for identifying outlying performance indicators. For evaluation purposes, we compare the proposed dissimilarity function with a dice-coefficient similarity function used in a related previous work. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms the existing method and correlates better to human judgements. In Comparison to other text outlier detection method, this approach managed to capture the semantics of documents through the use of CGs and is convenient to detect outliers through a simple dissimilarity function. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm retains a linear complexity with the increasing number of CGs.

16501;"An information arrangement technique for a text classification and summarization based on a summarization frame";0;"Tsuchiya, S. and Yoshimura, E. and Watabe, H.";"In this paper, the purpose is to arrange information to understand at one view. The proposed summarization frame technology is a system to hierarchically arrange and classify information by targeting content and level of importance in sentences. Moreover, the technique in which the Concept Base, the Degree of Association Algorithm, the Time Judgment system and the Place judgment system are used to understand content of sentences is proposed. The Concept Base generates semantics from a certain word, and the Degree of Association Algorithm uses the results of the semantics expansion to express the relationship between one word and another as a numeric value. Only needed information like the number of strokes limitation etc. can be easily extracted by hierarchically arranging information in the document summary. Moreover, the speed-up of the retrieval can be expected by narrowing the retrieval object in information retrieval. An answer matched to TPO can be expected to be achieved in a QA system. Sentences are classified according to the content. Each classification is classified into a more detailed field. Important keywords are extracted from the sentences classified into the field. Moreover, the extracted keywords are classified into common and peculiar word for the sentences in the field. In addition, sentences of each field hierarchize sentences to three stages according to the importance of the content. In addition, the sentences of each field are hierarchized at three levels according to the importance of the content.

In order to obtain an automatic bug triage system we used these techniques and performed comparative experiments. We downloaded 1,983 resolved bug reports along with the developer activity data from the Mozilla open source project. We extracted the relevant features like report title, report summary etc., from each bug report, and extracted developers name who resolved the bug reports from the developers activity data. We processed the extracted textual data, and obtained the term-to-document matrix using parsing, filtering and term weighting methods. For term weighting methods we used simple term frequency and TFIDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) methods. Furthermore, we reduced the dimensionality of the obtained term-to-document matrix by applying feature selection and latent semantic indexing methods. Finally we used seven different machine learning methods for the classification of bug reports.

16511;"Fully automatic text categorization by exploiting wordnet";0;"Li, J. and Zhao, Y. and Liu, B.";"This paper proposes a Fully Automatic Categorization approach for Text (FACT) by exploiting the semantic features from WordNet and document clustering. In FACT, the training data is constructed automatically by using the knowledge of the category name. With the support of WordNet, it first uses the category name to generate a set of features for the corresponding category. Then, a set of documents is labeled according to such features. To reduce the possible bias originating from the category name and generated features, document clustering is used to refine the quality of initial labeling. The training data are subsequently constructed to train the discriminative classifier. The empirical experiments show that the best performance of FACT can achieve more than 90% of the baseline SVM classifiers in F1 measure, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

16512;"sDoc: Exploring social wisdom for document enhancement in web mining";0;"Zhang, X.a  and Yang, L.b  and Wu, X.a  and Guo, H.a  and Guo, Z.a  and Bao, S.a  and Yu, Y.b  and Su, Z.a ";"Web document could be seen to be composed of textual content as well as social metadata of various forms (e.g., anchor text, search query and social annotation), both of which are valuable to indicate the semantic content of the document. However, due to the free nature of the web, the two streams of web data suffer from the serious problems of noise and sparseness, which have actually become the major challenges to the success of many web mining applications. Previous work has shown that it could enhance the content of web document by integrating anchor text and search query. In this paper, we study the problem of exploring emergent social annotation for document enhancement and propose a novel reinforcement framework to generate ""social representation"" of document. Distinguishing from prior work, textual content and social annotation are enhanced simultaneously in our framework, which is achieved by exploiting a kind of mutual reinforcement relationship behind them. Two convergent models, social content model and social annotation model, are symmetrically derived from the framework to represent enhanced textual content and enhanced social annotation respectively. The enhanced document is referred to as Social Document or sDoc in that it could embed complementary viewpoints from many web authors and many web visitors. In this sense, the document semantics is enhanced exactly by exploring social wisdom. We build the framework on a large Del.icio.us data and evaluate it through three typical web mining applications: annotation, classification and retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that social representation of web document could boost the performance of these applications significantly.

16528;"Augmenting web service discovery by cognitive semantics and abduction";0;"Bruza, P.D.a  and Barros, A.b  and Kaiser, M.b ";"We argue that web service discovery technology should help the user navigate a complex problem space by providing suggestions for services which they may not be able to formulate themselves as (s)he lacks the epistemic resources to do so. Free text documents in service environments provide an untapped source of information for augmenting the epistemic state of the user and hence their ability to search effectively for services. A quantitative approach to semantic knowledge representation is adopted in the form of semantic space models computed from these free text documents. Knowledge of the users agenda is promoted by associational inferences computed from the semantic space. The inferences are suggestive and aim to promote human abductive reasoning to guide the user from fuzzy search goals into a better understanding of the problem space surrounding the given agenda. Experimental results are discussed based on a complex and realistic planning activity.

16529;"Research on text classification algorithm by combining statistical and ontology methods";0;"Wu, G. and Liu, K.";"Traditional statistics based text classification methods almost construct their characteristic vectors with some key terms, and they consider terms are independent of each other and there are no semantic relations among them. However, in the real world, words used to have semantic relationships, such as synonym, hyponymy and so on. Therefore, classification methods based on statistics do not conform to the fact and the classification results also do not satisfying. To draw this problem, there is a need to obtain characteristic semantic information by taking advantage of ontology. With the help of the features of ontology - class hierarchical structure and property constraint, one can match the terms with domain ontology concepts and build up the concept vector space model. Using ontology method for text classification alone will lack scientific and stringency of the statistics. Taking all the above into consideration, this paper takes a combination of the two classification methods. Firstly, we choose the characteristics with statistics method and based on this, add in the ontology and form the concept vector space. Besides, we improve the KNN algorithm from two aspects. Finally, we implement a module for text classification of telecom domain. In the end, we make an analysis and comparison of the results of both statistics-only based (without improving the KNN algorithm) and the combination of two classification methods (with improved KNN).

In order to be efficient, such objects of a formal model, like vectors, have to reasonably reproduce language-related phenomena such as word meaning inherent in index terms. We introduce an algorithm for sense-based semantic ordering of index terms which approximates Cruses description of a sense spectrum. Following semantic ordering, text classification by support vector machines can benefit from semantic smoothing kernels that regard semantic relations among index terms while computing document similarity. Adding expansion terms to the vector representation can also improve effectiveness. This paper proposes a new kernel which discounts less important expansion terms based on lexical relatedness.

In the TF-IDF method, the weight of a term is a function of its frequency in the document and in overall document collection. The similarity computation by cosine similarity method is influenced by common terms (and their weight) between two document vectors and ignores the semantic relation between terms. We can use the generalization property of hierarchical knowledge repositories to establish that the terms correspond to specific instances of some generalized term. These generalized terms can be used to enrich the document vector, by enriching and weighting we intend to obtain better similarity values between two documents.

An effective dimension reduction method can not only reduce computation complexity, but help to improve the accuracy of text classification. This paper presents a new method of dimension reduction which is based on words semantic similarities. Being different with traditional methods which usually use the statistical information of words, natural language processing knowledge is used in our method which considers semantic information and POS information of feature terms. The experimental results show that our method is effective in dimensionality reduction of text representation and achieves a higher accuracy of text classification. The semantic similarity based method is a suitable method for text representation.

16549;"Semantically expanding questions for supervised automatic classification";0;"Harb, A. and Beigbeder, M. and Girardot, J.-J.";"Responding correctly to a question given a large collection of textual data is not an easy task. There is a need to perceive and recognize the question at a level that permits to detect some constraints that the question imposes on possible answers. The question classification task is used in Question Answering systems. This deduces the type of expected answer, to perform a semantic classification to the target answer. The purpose is to provide additional information to reduce the gap between answer and question to match them. An approach to ameliorate the effectiveness of classifiers focusing on the linguistic analysis (semantic, syntactic and morphological) and statistical approaches guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of fine grained questions types. This work also proposes two methods of questions expansion. The first finds for each word synonyms matching its contextual sense. The second one adds a high representation ""hypernym"" for the noun. Various representation features of documents, term weighting and diverse machine learning algorithms are studied. Experiments conducted on actual data are presented. Of interest is the improvement in the precision of the classification of questions.

16550;"Meaningful inner link objects for automatic text categorization";0;"Shen, J.-J. and Wu, J.-C.";"This paper presents a novel approach for automatic text categorization. The mainstream of the research on rule-based classifier regards document as a container of term, and generates rules by using the term distribution in documents. General speaking, there must be existed some kind of semantic relevance between term and paragraph in a document. We call it Meaningful Inner Link Objects-MILO which must be varied with different semantics of a document itself. While this paper concentrates on using these MILOs that associate with semantic relevance for text categorization, hence we focus on two problems: (1) finding the best MILOs which associate with semantic relevance; and (2) using these specific MILOs to build a classifier for text categorization. From the experiment results, our proposed classification approach base on MILO has a better accuracy while other state of the art technique without considering the relevance between term and paragraph.

16551;"Semantic approaches to fine and coarse-grained feature-based opinion mining";0;"Balahur, A. and Montoyo, A.";"Feature-based opinion mining from product reviews is a difficult task, both due to the high semantic variability of opinion expression, as well as because of the diversity of characteristics and sub-characteristics describing the products and the multitude of opinion words used to depict them. Further on, this task supposes not only the discovery of directly expressed opinions, but also the extraction of phrases that indirectly or implicitly value objects and their characteristics, by means of emotions or attitudes. Last, but not least, evaluation of results is difficult, because there is no standard corpus available that is annotated at such a fine-grained level and no annotation scheme defined for this purpose. This article presents our contributions to this task, given by the definition and application of an opinion annotation scheme, the testing of different methodologies to detect phrases related to different characteristics and the employment of Textual Entailment recognition for opinion mining. Finally, we test our approaches both on the built corpus, as well as on an ad-hoc built collection of reviews that we evaluate on the basis of the stars given. We prove that our approaches are appropriate and give high precision results.

16552;"A conceptlink graph for text structure mining";0;"Chau, R.a  and Tsoi, A.C.b  and Hagenbuchner, M.c  and Lee, V.C.S.a ";"Most text mining methods are based on representing documents using a vector space model, commonly known as a bag of word model, where each document is modeled as a linear vector representing the occurrence of independent words in the text corpus. It is well known that using this vector-based representation, important information, such as semantic relationship among concepts, is lost. This paper proposes a novel text representation model called ConceptLink graph. The ConceptLink graph does not only represent the content of the document, but also captures some of its underlying semantic structure in terms of the relationships among concepts. The ConceptLink graph is constructed in two main stages. First, we find a set of concepts by clustering conceptually related terms using the self-organizing map method. Secondly, by mapping each documents content to concept, we generate a graph of concepts based on the occurrences of concepts using a singular value decomposition technique. The ConceptLink graph will overcome the keyword independence limitation in the vector space model to take advantage of the implicit concept relationships exhibit in all natural language texts. As an information-rich text representation model, the ConceptLink graph will advance text mining technology beyond feature-based to structure-based knowledge discovery. We will illustrate the ConceptLink graph method using samples generated from benchmark text mining dataset.

The novelty of the paper lies in identifying key snippet from text to validate the interaction between a pair of entities. The extracted information components are exploited to generate semantic network which provides distinct user perspectives and allows navigation over documents with similar information components. The efficacy of the proposed framework is established through experiments carried out on biomedical text documents extracted through PubMed search engine.

16558;"Implicit customer relations mining with the Event-Indexing Model";0;"Guo, Y.a  and Shao, Z.a  and Hua, N.b ";"Exploration of explicit and, especially, implicit information of customers is a vital task for industrial enterprises and organizations. Text and data mining are two indispensable means to accomplish above task. This paper presents a hybrid mining system, EIREx, which processes unstructured (text documents) and structured (data tables from databases) information as a whole source. The construction of EIREx is inspired by a cognitive situation model, Event-Indexing Model. EIREx monitors customer information in multidimensional vectors to simulate cognitive understanding processes of human beings. To ensure accuracy, EIREx implements syntactic parsing, lexical reference and semantic analysis in information extraction procedures from mining sources. In the procedures of information integration and cross referencing, EIREx delivers a structural description to reveal implicit connections among existing customers, which are valuable for further analysis of customer orders and purchase motivations or intentions, and dealing with customers complaints and suggestions.

16559;"A framework of a logic-based question-answering system for the medical domain (LOQAS-Med)";0;"Athenikos, S.J.a  and Han, H.a  and Brooks, A.D.b ";"Question-answering systems that provide precise answers to questions, by combining techniques for information retrieval, information extraction, and natural language processing, are seen as the next-generation search engines. Due to the growth and real-world impact of biomedical information, the need for question-answering systems that can aid medical researchers and health care professionals in their information search is acutely felt. In order to provide users with accurate answers, such systems need to go beyond lexico-syntactic analysis to semantic analysis and processing of texts and knowledge resources. Moreover, question-answering systems equipped with reasoning capabilities can derive more adequate answers by using inference. Research on question answering in the medical and health care domain is still in its inception stage. While several recent approaches to medical question answering have explored use of semantic knowledge, few approaches have exploited the utility of logic formalisms and of inference mechanisms. In this paper, we present a framework for a logic-based question-answering system for the medical domain, which uses Description Logic as the formalism for knowledge representation and reasoning. As a first step toward building the proposed system, we present semantic analysis and classification of medical questions.

16560;"Combining lexical stability and improved lexical chain for unsupervised word sense disambiguation";0;"Chen, J.a  and Liu, J.a  and Yu, W.b  and Wu, P.a ";"Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a traditional AI-hard problem. An improvement of WSD would have a significant impact on applications such as knowledge acquisition, text mining, information extraction, etc. Lexical chain holds a set of semantically related words of a text and provides an effective way for WSD, but existing lexical chain systems have inaccuracies in WSD for lacking a weighting scheme to measure the weights of word senses. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised WSD method based on lexical stability and improved lexical chain. This method can disambiguate all words with a high accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on SemCor corpus which is widely used for evaluating the accuracy of the WSD algorithm. Empirical results show that the algorithm can achieve a significant higher accuracy than state-of-the-art result.

16562;"Characteristics of document similarity measures for compliance analysis";0;"Sayeed, A.a  and Sarkar, S.b  and Deng, Y.b  and Hosn, R.b  and Mahindru, R.b  and Rajamani, N.c ";"Due to increased competition in the IT Services business, improving quality, reducing costs and shortening schedules has become extremely important. A key strategy being adopted for achieving these goals is the use of an asset-based approach to service delivery, where standard reusable components developed by domain experts are minimally modified for each customer instead of creating custom solutions. One example of this approach is the use of contract templates, one for each type of service offered. A compliance checking system that measures how well actual contracts adhere to standard templates is critical for ensuring the success of such an approach. This paper describes the use of document similarity measures - Cosine similarity and Latent Semantic Indexing - to identify the top candidate templates on which a more detailed (and expensive) compliance analysis can be performed. Comparison of results of using the different methods are presented.

16564;"An ontology-driven approach to web search: Analysis of its sensitivity to ontology quality and search tasks";0;"Tomassen, S.L.a  and Strasunskas, D.b ";"An increasing number of recent information retrieval systems makes use of ontologies to help the users to detail queries and to come up with semantic representations of documents. A particular concern here is user-friendliness (usability) and scalability of those approaches for Web search purposes. In this paper, we present an approach where entities in an ontology are associated with domain terminology by feature vectors (FV). A FV reflects the semantic and linguistic neighbourhoods of a particular entity. The semantic neighbourhood is derived from an ontology and is based on related entities and specified properties, while linguistic neighbourhood is based on co-location of terms in a text corpus. Later, during the search process the FVs are used to filter and rerank the search results of the underlying search engine and thereby increasing the precision of the result. We elaborate on the approach and describe how the FVs are constructed. Then we report on a conducted evaluation where we analyse the sensitivity of the approach w.r.t. ontology quality and search tasks. Results indicate that the proposed approach and implemented prototype are able to improve the search results of a standard Web search engine. Furthermore, the analysis of the experiment data shows that the level of ontology specification is important for the quality of the FVs.

Recent research on question classification for open-domain mostly concentrates on using machine learning methods to resolve the special kind of text classification.

SVM has been widely used for question classification and got good performances. We use SVM as the classifier and propose a new feature extraction method of Chinese questions which is called semantic gram extraction. The method is proposed based on the word semantics and N-gram.

In this paper we study temporal text mining methods for Music Information Retrieval. We compare two ways of detecting the temporal latent semantics of a corpus extracted from Wikipedia, using a stepwise Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) approach and a global multiway PLSA method. The analysis indicates that the global analysis method is able to identify relevant trends which are difficult to get using a step-by-step approach. Furthermore we show that inspection of PLSA models with different number of factors may reveal the stability of temporal clusters making it possible to choose the relevant number of factors.

The tools act as the media into which users projects the maps that has already more-or-less matured in their minds. In this work, we present a software tool that automatically generates mind maps directly from text. This tool provides a prospect to transform many literatures automatically into mind maps.

This paper presents a coclustering-based verb synonym extraction approach that increases the number of extracted meanings of polysemous verbs from a large text corpus. For verb synonym extraction with a clustering approach dealing with polysemous verbs can be one problem issue because each polysemous verb should be categorized into different clusters depending on each meaning; thus there is a high possibility of failing to extract some of the meanings of polysemous verbs. Our proposed approach can extract the different meanings of polysemous verbs by recursively eliminating the extracted clusters from the initial data set. The experimental results of verb synonym extraction show that the proposed approach increases the correct verb clusters by about 50% with a 0.9% increase in precision and a 1.5% increase in recall over the previous approach.

16577;"A new text categorization method based on SVD and cascade correlation algorithm";0;"Wang, Y.X. and Deng, W.";"A new text categorization method based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Cascade Correlation (CC) algorithm is proposed. Most traditional classification systems represent the contents of documents with Vector Space Model (VSM) which represents documents with a set of index terms. However, this model needs a high dimensional space to represent the documents and it does not take into account the semantic relationship between terms, which could lead to poor classification performance. In contrast, SVD can represent relations among very large number of words and very large number of natural text passages in which they occur. It can not only greatly reduce the dimensionality but also discover the important relationships between terms. Based on this idea, we use singular value decomposition (SVD) to represent our documents in this paper. Then we use neural network constructed by cascade correlation (CC) algorithm to classify these represented documents. The experiments show that our method helps to accelerate the training speed and improves the classification accuracy as well.

The AP-Sets mining structure allows the building of an intermediate representation for texts based on the Apriori property. This intermediate form has the shape of a lattice of text itemsets, and can be translated into a basic ontology using semantic relations extracted from WordNet lexical database. The ontology generated can be seen as a summarized structured description of the contents of the textual attribute. Furthermore, it adds semantic capabilities to the query process on textual attributes.

The task of sentiment classification is to construct an effective classifier with the knowledge data of vocabularies semantic meaning and the relationships between the vocabularies to determine the sentiment orientation of a document. In this paper, one method combining HowNet knowledge base with a robust supervised sentiment classifier is proposed. It computes semantic similarity of characteristic words and phrases by using HowNet. Sentiment features of text are divided into characteristic words and phrases, and they adopt the positive and negative terms as features of sentiment classifier. Finally in the experiment, evaluation results show the effectiveness of our method.

16581;"Classifying disease outbreak reports using n-grams and semantic features";0;"Conway, M. and Doan, S. and Kawazoe, A. and Collier, N.";"Introduction: This paper explores the benefits of using n-grams and semantic features for the classification of disease outbreak reports, in the context of the BioCaster disease outbreak report text mining system. A novel feature of this work is the use of a general purpose semantic tagger - the USAS tagger - to generate features. Background: We outline the application context for this work (the BioCaster epidemiological text mining system), before going on to describe the experimental data used in our classification experiments (the 1000 document BioCaster corpus). Feature sets: Three broad groups of features are used in this work: Named Entity based features, n-gram features, and features derived from the USAS semantic tagger. Methodology: Three standard machine learning algorithms - NaÃ¯ve Bayes, the Support Vector Machine algorithm, and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm - were used for classifying experimental data (that is, the BioCaster corpus). Feature selection was performed using the Ï‡2 feature selection algorithm. Standard text classification performance metrics - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity and F-score - are reported. Results: A feature representation composed of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and features derived from a semantic tagger, in conjunction with the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm and feature selection yielded the highest classification accuracy (and F-score). This result was statistically significant compared to a baseline unigram representation and to previous work on the same task. However, it was feature selection rather than semantic tagging that contributed most to the improved performance. Conclusion: This study has shown that for the classification of disease outbreak reports, a combination of bag-of-words, n-grams and semantic features, in conjunction with feature selection, increases classification accuracy at a statistically significant level compared to previous work in this domain.

A crucial question which has not been answered so far is whether models based on explicitly given concepts (as in the ESA model for instance) perform inherently better than retrieval models based on ""latent"" concepts (as in LSI and/or LDA). In this paper we investigate this question closer in the context of a cross-language setting, which inherently requires concept-based retrieval bridging between different languages.

An authors intention plays a major role in successfully understanding a text. For supporting readers in this task, we present an intentional approach to visual text analysis, making use of tag clouds. The objective of tag clouds is presenting meta-information in a visually appealing way. How ever there is also much uncertainty associated with tag clouds, such as giving the wrong impression. It is not clear whether the authors intent can be grasped clearly while looking at a corresponding tag cloud. Therefore it is interesting to ask to what extent, with tag clouds, it is possible to support the user in understanding intentions expressed. In order to answer this question, we construct an intentional perspective on textual content. Based on an existing algorithm for extracting intent annotations from textual content we present a prototypical implementation to produce intent tag clouds, and describe a formative testing, illustrating how intent visualizations may support readers in understanding a text successfully. With the initial prototype, we conducted user studies of our intentional tag cloud visualization and a comparison with a traditional one that visualizes frequent terms.

Aside from providing answers to natural language questions, the system offers explanations for these answers via a visual representation of documents, their associated list of facts described by subject - verb - object triplets, and their summaries. The triplets, automatically extracted from the Penn Treebank parse tree obtained for each sentence in the document collection, can be searched, and we have implemented a question answering system to serve as a natural language interface to this search. The vocabulary of questions is general because it is not limited to a specific domain, however the questionss grammatical structure is restricted to a predetermined template because our system can understand only a limited number of question types. The answers are retrieved from the set of facts, and they are supported by sentences and their corresponding document. The document overview, comprising the semantic representation of the document generated in the form of a semantic graph, the list of facts it contains and its automatically derived summary, offers an explanation to each answer. The extracted triplets are further refined by assigning the corresponding co referenced named entity, by resolving pronominal anaphors, as well as attaching the associated WordNet synset.

16593;"Named entity resolution using automatically extracted semantic information";0;"Pilz, A. and PaaÃŸ, G.";"One major problem in text mining and semantic retrieval is that detected entity mentions have to be assigned to the true underlying entity. The ambiguity of a name results from both the polysemy and synonymy problem, as the name of a unique entity may be written in variant ways and different unique entities may have the same name. The term ""bush"" for instance may refer to a woody plant, a mechanical fixing, a nocturnal primate, 52 persons and 8 places covered in Wikipedia and thousands of other persons. For the first time, according to our knowledge we apply a kernel entity resolution approach to the German Wikipedia as reference for named entities. We describe the context of named entities in Wikipedia and the context of a detected name phrase in a new document by a context vector of relevant features. These are designed from automatically extracted topic indicators generated by an LDA topic model. We use kernel classifiers, e.g. rank classifiers, to determine the right matching entity but also to detect uncovered entities. In comparison to a baseline approach using only text similarity the addition of topics approach gives a much higher f-value, which is comparable to the results published for English.

String kernel computes the similarity of a pair of documents by comparing common substrings they have. Experimental results show that our method greatly enhances the classification on small training data sets. Although the performance of traditional string kernel is comparable to that of BOW methods on larger data set, the dimension of feature space is so high that the calculation process is very time-consuming.

During mammography screening, radiologists use a strict lexicon (BI-RADS) to describe and report their findings. Mammography records are then stored in a well-defined database format (NMD). Lately, researchers have applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these databases. They successfully built breast cancer classifiers that can help in early detection of malignancy. However, the validity of these models depends on the quality of the underlying databases. Unfortunately, most databases suffer from inconsistencies, missing data, inter-observer variability and inappropriate term usage. In addition, many databases are not compliant with the NMD format and/or solely consist of text reports. BI-RADS feature extraction from free text and consistency checks between recorded predictive variables and text reports are crucial to addressing this problem. We describe a general scheme for concept information retrieval from free text given a lexicon, and present a BI-RADS features extraction algorithm for clinical data mining. It consists of a syntax analyzer, a concept finder and a negation detector. The syntax analyzer preprocesses the input into individual sentences. The concept finder uses a semantic grammar based on the BI-RADS lexicon and the experts input. It parses sentences detecting BI-RADS concepts. Once a concept is located, a lexical scanner checks for negation. Our method can handle multiple latent concepts within the text, filtering out ultrasound concepts. On our dataset, our algorithm achieves 97.7% precision, 95.5% recall and an F1-score of 0.97. It outperforms manual feature extraction at the 5% statistical significance level.

16623;"Entity resolution in texts using statistical learning and ontologies";0;"Å tajner, T. and MladeniÄ‡, D.";"Ambiguities, which are inherently present in natural languages represent a challenge of determining the actual identities of entities mentioned in a document (e.g., Paris can refer to a city in France but it can also refer to a small city in Texas, USA or to a 1984 film directed by Wim Wenders having title Paris, Texas). Disambiguation is a problem that can be successfully solved by entity resolution methods. This paper studies various methods for estimating relatedness between entities, used in collective entity resolution. We define a unified entity resolution approach, capable of using implicit as well as explicit relatedness for collectively identifying in-text entities. As a relatedness measure, we propose a method, which expresses relatedness using the heterogeneous relations of a domain ontology.

16627;"Early aspect identification from use cases using NLP and WSD techniques";0;"Rago, A.a  and Abait, E.S.b  and Marcos, C.b  and Diaz-Pace, A.c ";"In this article, we present a semi-automated approach for identifying candidate early aspects in requirements specifications. This approach aims at improving the precision of the aspect identification process in use cases, and also solving some problems of existing aspect mining techniques caused by the vagueness and ambiguity of text in natural language. To do so, we apply a combination of text analysis techniques such as: natural language processing (NLP) and word sense disambiguation (WSD). As a result, our approach is able to generate a graph of candidate concerns that crosscut the use cases, as well as a ranking of these concerns according to their importance. The developer then selects which concerns are relevant for his/her domain. Although there are still some challenges, we argue that this approach can be easily integrated into a UML development methodology, leading to improved requirements elicitation.

16633;"Density-based clustering of massive short messages using domain ontology";0;"Yang, S.a  and Wang, Y.b ";"With the rapid development of information technology, huge data is accumulated. A vast amount of such data appears as short messages such as emails in companies or conversations in open chatting rooms. It is useful to find the themes or exceptional information from the messages by clustering the short documents based on density. However, traditional vector space model based text clustering algorithms can not get acceptable accuracy because the key words appear at low frequency. On the other hand, traditional text clustering algorithms become very inefficient or even unavailable when processing massive data at TB level. In this paper a densitybased short message clustering algorithm using domain ontology based is presented. This algorithm uses domain ontology to calculate the semantic similarity between short messages which improves the Parallel method is also used to get better scalability.

To get this goal, this work started with the investigation of lexical and semantic domain of radiological texts, followed by the design and implementation of an ontology, called RadOn, and the modeling of a database based on it. The next step was the development of a set of integrated software components, called E-Rad, based on text mining techniques, which identifies and extracts words, terms and expressions from free texts, adjusts them to the ontology structure and stores them. Finally, a query engine that works on the E-Rad structure, having a user interface, was implemented. The outcome is a computational environment that, by means of the implemented ontology and related tools, makes the data semantic explicit and allows the use of the context information in an optimal and standard way.

In order to improve the ability of expression in the semantic information, this paper presents a new text structure graph model. With the weighted graph, this model expresses the characteristics term of the text and its associated location information.

However, named entities have ontological features, namely, their aliases, types, and identifiers, which are hidden from their textual appearance. In this paper, we explore weighted combinations of those latent named entity features with keywords for text clustering. To that end, the traditional Vector Space Model is adapted with multiple vectors defined over spaces of entity names, types, name-type pairs, identifiers, and keywords. Clustering quality is evaluated by both of the self purity-separation type and the relative comparison type of measures. Hard and fuzzy clustering experiments of the proposed model on selected data subsets of Reuters-21578 are conducted and evaluated.

16642;"Automatic tag recommendation for weblogs";0;"Liu, Y. and Liu, M. and Chen, X. and Xiang, L. and Yang, Q.";"There have been many researches on how to recommend tags for weblogs. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic tag recommendation algorithm, which can be used in the large-scale and real-time data process effectively and efficiently. Most existing researches on tag suggestion focus on firstly mining the relationship between testing and training data and then assigning the top ranked tags of the most related training data to the testing object. However, they ignore the internal relationship between tags and weblogs. According to our research, more than 43% tags, which have been labeled by weblog users, have actually been used in the body of the text. At the meanwhile, the term frequency distribution, the paragraph frequency distribution and the first occurrence position of tags are very different from the ones of non-tags in the text. In this paper, the tags of a weblog are assigned in two steps. First of all, some probability distributions of the word attributes are trained by the labeled training weblogs, and some keywords of a testing weblog are extracted as one part of the tags based on the probability distributions. Then the other part of the tags are obtained from the first part ones with the help of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model. Experiments on a large-scale tagging dataset of weblogs 12 show that the average tagging time for a new weblog is less than 0.02 seconds, and over 74% testing weblogs are correctly labeled with the top 15 tags.

Finally new ontology instances are extracted from the new texts according to the training results. The advantage of this method is that the semantic of ontology elements in texts is made full use of, and instances extraction and classification are completed in the identical procedure at same time. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of instances extraction and classification reached 86.6%, which is satisfactory.

16648;"Exploiting wikipedia as external knowledge for document clustering";0;"Hu, X.a  and Zhang, X.a  and Lu, C.a  and Park, E.K.b  and Zhou, X.a ";"In traditional text clustering methods, documents are represented as ""bags of words"" without considering the semantic information of each document. For instance, if two documents use different collections of core words to represent the same topic, they may be falsely assigned to different clusters due to the lack of shared core words, although the core words they use are probably synonyms or semantically associated in other forms. The most common way to solve this problem is to enrich document representation with the background knowledge in an ontology. There are two major issues for this approach: (1) the coverage of the ontology is limited, even for WordNet or Mesh, (2) using ontology terms as replacement or additional features may cause information loss, or introduce noise. In this paper, we present a novel text clustering method to address these two issues by enriching document representation with Wikipedia concept and category information. We develop two approaches, exact match and relatedness-match, to map text documents to Wikipedia concepts, and further to Wikipedia categories. Then the text documents are clustered based on a similarity metric which combines document content information, concept information as well as category information. The experimental results using the proposed clustering framework on three datasets (20-newsgroup, TDT2, and LA Times) show that clustering performance improves significantly by enriching document representation with Wikipedia concepts and categories.

16649;"Visual analysis of documents with semantic graphs";0;"Rusu, D. and Fortuna, B. and MladeniÄ‡, D. and Grobelnik, M. and SipoÅ¡, R.";"In this paper, we present a technique for visual analysis of documents based on the semantic representation of text in the form of a directed graph, referred to as semantic graph. This approach can aid data mining tasks, such as exploratory data analysis, data description and summarization. In order to derive the semantic graph, we take advantage of natural language processing, and carry out a series of operations comprising a pipeline, as follows. Firstly, named entities are identified and coreference resolution is performed; moreover, pronominal anaphors are resolved for a subset of pronouns. Secondly, subject - predicate - object triplets are automatically extracted from the Penn Treebank parse tree obtained for each sentence in the document. The triplets are further enhanced by linking them to their corresponding co-referenced named entity, as well as attaching the associated WordNet synset, where available. Thus we obtain a semantic directed graph composed of connected triplets. The documents semantic graph is a starting point for automatically generating the document summary. The model for summary generation is obtained by machine learning, where the features are extracted from the semantic graph structure and content. The summary also has an associated semantic representation. The size of the semantic graph, as well as the summary length can be manually adjusted for an enhanced visual analysis. We also show how to employ the proposed technique for the Visual Analytics challenge.Â© 2009 ACM.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";27;"2009";"Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Visual Analytics and Knowledge Discovery, VAKD 09";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70350635468&partnerID=40&md5=da8b7cb4c108ceb3e909342ecee54ea0";;"66-73";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"30/07/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"representacao semantica, visualizacao";"null";"semantic graph";"Wordnet";"null";"pre-processamento, sumarizacao";"null";"PLN, reconhecimento de entidades nomeadas";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"8"
16650;"Extracting domain-dependent semantic orientations of latent variables for sentiment classification";0;"Lee, Y. and Kim, J. and Lee, J.-H.";"Sentiment analysis of weblogs is a challenging problem. Most previous work utilized semantic orientations of words or phrases to classify sentiments of weblogs. The problem with this approach is that semantic orientations of words or phrases are investigated without considering the domain of weblogs. Weblogs contain the authors various opinions about multifaceted topics. Therefore, we have to treat a semantic orientation domain-dependently. In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning model based on aspect model to classify sentiments of weblogs. Our model utilizes domain-dependent semantic orientations of latent variables instead of words or phrases, and uses them to classify sentiments of weblogs. Experiments on several domains confirm that our model assigns domain-dependent semantic orientations to latent variables correctly, and classifies sentiments of weblogs effectively.

16657;"Using non-extensive entropy for text classification";0;"Fu, L. and Hou, Y.";"This paper proposes the use of non-extensive entropy for text classification. Non-extensive entropy technique is used for text classification by estimating the conditional distribution of the class variable given the document. The underlying principle of non-extensive entropy is that without external knowledge, one should prefer distributions that are uniform. This paper proposes two models for text classification based on maximum entropy principle. The first model extends Shannon entropy into non-extensive entropy to simplify the form of classifier, the other one introduces high-level constraints into non-extensive model to impose constraints on the pairs of entities. Model with high-level constraints constructs relations between word pairs which builds semantic constraints, for the sake of advancing accuracy of text classification. Experiments on the 20-newsgroup set demonstrate the advantage of non-extensive model and non-extensive model with high-level constraints.

The KC method has been successfully applied to mine causal relations from oil platform accident reports. In a comparison with association rule techniques for the same domain, KC has shown a significant improvement in the extraction of relevant knowledge, using processing complexity and knowledge manageability as the evaluation criteria.

Once triplets have been generated, we apply several techniques in order to obtain the semantic graph of the document: co-reference and anaphora resolution of named entities and semantic normalization of triplets. Finally, we describe the automatic document summarization process starting from the semantic representation of the text.

Semantic technologies promise a next generation of semantic search engines, which will be able to answer questions. Current approaches either apply natural language processing to unstructured text or they assume the existence of structured statements over which they can reason. Results: Here, we introduce a third approach, GoWeb, which combines classical keyword-based Web search with text-mining and ontologies to navigate large results sets and facilitate question answering. We evaluate GoWeb on three benchmarks of questions on genes and functions, on symptoms and diseases, and on proteins and diseases. The first benchmark is based on the BioCreAtivE 1 Task 2 and links 457 gene names with 1352 functions. GoWeb finds 58% of the functional GeneOntology annotations. The second benchmark is based on 26 case reports and links symptoms with diseases. GoWeb achieves 77% success rate improving an existing approach by nearly 20%. The third benchmark is based on 28 questions in the TREC genomics challenge and links proteins to diseases. GoWeb achieves a success rate of 79%.

Traditional brand image and reputation tracking is limited to news wires and contact centre analysis. However, with the emergence of web, Consumer Generated Media (CGM), such as blogs, news forums, message boards, and web pages/sites, is rapidly becoming the ""voice of the people"". Effectively leveraging such readily available and massive amount of CGM content for brand and reputation insights can be extremely valuable to corporations. Yet the existing solutions in this space are commonly limited to keyword search based technologies that often result in excessive amount of information for users to digest manually. Some text mining based technologies exist for mining the web. However, they often target very narrow problems such as web page classification instead of looking at the overall stack of technologies required for web mining. This paper describes a holistically integrated brand and reputation analysis solution that mines CGM contents for insights, called COBRA (COrporate Brand and Reputation Analysis). COBRA contains a flexible ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) engine that processes diverse sets of structured and unstructured information, a suite of analytical capabilities that mines CGM content to extract semantic entities and insights out of the data, and an alerting mechanism that utilizes a technique called ""orthogonal filtering"" to accurately generate brand and reputation alerts by filtering through orthogonal dimensions of information. We use a set of real-world case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our overall approach. We show that by applying such analytics techniques, we significantly improved the accuracy of alert identification by 10-200 times when compared to the popular keyword-search based techniques in todays alerting systems.

The extracted concepts and relations are then used to develop semantic representations of the important knowledge expressed in the documents. The process of knowledge extraction from textual documents is, however, a subjective task that may differ from one person to another. This paper presents the two evaluation methods used to compare the performance of the CRISP technique with human evaluators. In the first method, Kappa was used to measure the level of agreement of human evaluators on the concepts extracted from an evaluation set, and the level of agreement between human evaluators and CRISP on the same evaluation set. In the second method, a Gold Standard was developed from the results of the human evaluators and precision and recall for CRISP and the human evaluators were calculated based on the Gold Standard. F-measure was used to combine precision and recall and to consequently compare between the performance of CRISP and the performance of the humanevaluators. Results from both evaluation methods were relatively comparable.

16684;"A Semantic Scattering model for the automatic interpretation of English genitives";0;"Badulescu, A. and Moldovan, D.";"An important problem in knowledge discovery from text is the automatic extraction of semantic relations. This paper addresses the automatic classification of the semantic relations expressed by English genitives. A learning model is introduced based on the statistical analysis of the distribution of genitives semantic relations in a corpus. The semantic and contextual features of the genitives noun phrase constituents play a key role in the identification of the semantic relation. The algorithm was trained and tested on a corpus of approximately 20,000 sentences and achieved an f-measure of 79.80 per cent for of-genitives, far better than the 40.60 per cent obtained using a Decision Trees algorithm, the 50.55 per cent obtained using a Naive Bayes algorithm, or the 72.13 per cent obtained using a Support Vector Machines algorithm on the same corpus using the same features. The results were similar for s-genitives: 78.45 per cent using Semantic Scattering, 47.00 per cent using Decision Trees, 43.70 per cent using Naive Bayes, and 70.32 per cent using a Support Vector Machines algorithm. The results demonstrate the importance of word sense disambiguation and semantic generalization/ specialization for this task. They also demonstrate that different patterns (in our case the two types of genitive constructions) encode different semantic information and should be treated differently in the sense that different models should be built for different patterns.

16686;"Semi-structured document categorization with a semantic kernel";0;"Aseervatham, S. and Bennani, Y.";"Since a decade, text categorization has become an active field of research in the machine learning community. Most of the approaches are based on the term occurrence frequency. The performance of such surface-based methods can decrease when the texts are too complex, i.e., ambiguous. One alternative is to use the semantic-based approaches to process textual documents according to their meaning. Furthermore, research in text categorization has mainly focused on ""flat texts"" whereas many documents are now semi-structured and especially under the XML format. In this paper, we propose a semantic kernel for semi-structured biomedical documents. The semantic meanings of words are extracted using the unified medical language system (UMLS) framework. The kernel, with a SVM classifier, has been applied to a text categorization task on a medical corpus of free text documents. The results have shown that the semantic kernel outperforms the linear kernel and the naive Bayes classifier. Moreover, this kernel was ranked in the top 10 of the best algorithms among 44 classification methods at the 2007 Computational Medicine Center (CMC) Medical NLP International Challenge.

16690;"Knowledge fusion framework based on web page texts";0;"Hu, S.a  and Cao, Y.b ";"With the proliferation of Web page texts, it is important to fuse these texts to useful documents that users need. However, there is still no complete and unified theoretical model for studying the research issues including redundancy, localization, and fuzziness existing in the process of fusing Web page texts. This paper proposes a fusion framework called Web Pages Knowledge Fusion Framework (WP-KFF) to synthesize the knowledge of Web page texts. First, sentences in Web page texts are extracted and transformed into triple semantic net as knowledge representation. Then a semantic description of attribute fusion rules, description information fusion rules and attribute-value and description information fusion rules are defined in WPKFF. These rules are used to fuse the attributes of same domain concepts in triple semantic net. The features of attributes include description (string) and value data (number). The results of the experiments indicate that the fusion framework is a feasible model in terms of precision and recall.

The variability of natural language expression makes it difficult for existing text similarity measures to accurately identify semantically similar sentences since sentences conveying the same fact or concept may be composed lexically and syntactically different. Inversely, sentences which are lexically common may not necessarily convey the same meaning. This poses a significant impact on many text mining applications performance where sentence-level judgment is involved. The evaluation has shown that, by processing sentence at its semantic level, the performance of similarity measures is significantly improved.

However, simple word counting and frequency distributions of term appearances do not capture the meaning behind the words, which results in limiting the ability to mine the texts. In this paper, the application of a semantic understanding based approach to mine documents is presented. The approach is based on semantic notions to represent text, and to measure similarity between text documents. The representation scheme reflects existing relations between concepts and facilitates accurate similarity measurements that result in better mining performance. A document mining process, namely semantic document clustering, is investigated and tackled in various ways. The proposed representation scheme along with the proposed similarity measure were implemented as vital components of a mining system. The approach has enabled more effective document clustering than what conventional techniques would provide. The experimental work is reported, and its results are presented and analyzed.

There has been some initial evidence that the phenomenon of quantum entanglement exists in a semantic space and can potentially play a crucial role in determining the embeded semantics. In this paper, we propose to consider pure high-order entanglements that cannot be reduced to the compositional effect of lower-order ones, as an indicator of high-level semantic entities. To characterize the intrinsic order of entanglements and distinguish pure high-order entanglements from lower-order ones, we develop a set of methods in the framework of Information Geometry. Based on the developed methods, we propose an expanded vector space model that involves context-sensitive high-order information and aims at characterizing high-level retrieval contexts.

16719;"A concept vector space model for semantic kernels";0;"Aseervatham, S.";"Kernels are widely used in Natural Language Processing as similarity measures within inner-product based learning methods like the Support Vector Machine. The Vector Space Model (VSM) is extensively used for the spatial representation of the documents. However, it is purely a statistical representation. In this paper, we present a Concept Vector Space Model (CVSM) representation which uses linguistic prior knowledge to capture the meanings of the documents. We also propose a linear kernel and a latent kernel for this space. The linear kernel takes advantage of the linguistic concepts whereas the latent kernel combines statistical and linguistic concepts.

16721;"Knowledge acquisition from textual documents for the construction of medicinal herbs domain ontology";0;"Zaharudin, I.a  and Noah, S.A.a  and Noor, M.M.b ";"In this study a semi automatic acquisition of domain relevant terms from digital documents in e-newspaper related to Malaysian medicinal herbs is presented. This study proposes (1) TFIDF-based term classification method for acquiring single word terms, (2) recognition of multi-word using TerMine software to acquire multiword terms and (3) Hearsts methodology of acquiring semantic relationships of hyponym. The results show the benefits of using these methods in selecting relevant terms from domain specific corpus. From this study it is believed that the combination of these three methods might be helpful to select relevant terms as well as minimize the effort to discard irrelevant terms manually-from wide collection of terms from the corpus.

16722;"Construction of supervised and unsupervised learning systems for multilingual text categorization";0;"Lee, C.-H.a  and Yang, H.-C.b ";"Due to the availability of a huge amount of textual data from a variety of sources, users of internationally distributed information regions need effective methods and tools that enable them to discover, retrieve and categorize relevant information, in whatever language and form it may have been stored. This drives a convergence of numerous interests from diverse research communities focusing on the issues related to multilingual text categorization. In this work, we implemented and measured the performance of the leading supervised and unsupervised approaches for multilingual text categorization. We selected support vector machines (SVM) as representative of supervised techniques as well as latent semantic indexing (LSI) and self-organizing maps (SOM) techniques as our selective ones of unsupervised methods for system implementation. The preliminary results show that our platform models including both supervised and unsupervised learning methods have the potentials for multilingual text categorization. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

16730;"Wikipedia-based semantic interpretation for natural language processing";0;"Gabrilovich, E. and Markovitch, S.";"Adequate representation of natural language semantics requires access to vast amounts of common sense and domain-specific world knowledge. Prior work in the field was based on purely statistical techniques that did not make use of background knowledge, on limited lexicographic knowledge bases such as WordNet, or on huge manual efforts such as the CYC project. Here we propose a novel method, called Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), for fine-grained semantic interpretation of unrestricted natural language texts. Our method represents meaning in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia in existence. We explicitly represent the meaning of any text in terms of Wikipedia-based concepts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on text categorization and on computing the degree of semantic relatedness between fragments of natural language text. Using ESA results in significant improvements over the previous state of the art in both tasks. Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain to human users.

16733;"Exploiting gene ontology to conceptualize biomedical document collections";0;"Zheng, H.-T. and Borchert, C. and Kim, H.-G.";"As biomedical science progresses, ontologies play an increasingly important role in easing the understanding of biomedical information. Although much research, such as Gene Ontology annotation, has been proposed to utilize ontologies to help users understand biomedical information easily, most of the research does not focus on capturing gene-related terms and their relationships within biomedical document collections. Understanding key gene-related terms as well as their semantic relationships is essential for comprehending the conceptual structure of biomedical document collections and avoiding information overload for users. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called GOClonto to automatically generate ontologies for conceptualization of biomedical document collections. Based on GO (Gene Ontology), GOClonto extracts gene-related terms from biomedical text, applies latent semantic analysis to identify key gene-related terms, allocates documents based on the key gene-related terms, and utilizes GO to automatically generate a corpus-related gene ontology. The experimental results show that GOClonto is able to identify key gene-related terms. For a test biomedical document collection, GOClonto shows better performance than other clustering algorithms in terms of F-measure. Moreover, the ontology generated by GOClonto shows a significant informative conceptual structure.

We examine the changes in the Open Directory Project ontology of Web pages over a period of several years and analyze the most common types of structural changes that took place during that time. We then present an approach for predicting one of the more common types of structural changes, namely the addition of a new concept that becomes the subconcept of an existing parent concept and adopts a few instances of this existing parent concept. We describe how this task can be formulated as a machine-learning problem and present an experimental evaluation of this approach that shows promising results of the proposed approach.

However, people can categorize documents into named categories without any explicit training because we know the meaning of category names. In this paper, we introduce Dataless Classification, a learning protocol that uses world knowledge to induce classifiers without the need for any labeled data. Like humans, a dataless classifier interprets a string of words as a set of semantic concepts. We propose a model for dataless classification and show that the label name alone is often sufficient to induce classifiers. Using Wikipedia as our source of world knowledge, we get 85.29% accuracy on tasks from the 20 Newsgroup dataset and 88.62% accuracy on tasks from a Yahoo! Answers dataset without any labeled or unlabeled data from the datasets. With unlabeled data, we can further improve the results and show quite competitive performance to a supervised learning algorithm that uses 100 labeled examples.

16749;"Topic-bridged PLSA for cross-domain text classification";0;"Xue, G.-R.a  and Dai, W.a  and Yang, Q.b  and Yu, Y.a ";"In many Web applications, such as blog classification and newsgroup classification, labeled data are in short supply. It often happens that obtaining labeled data in a new domain is expensive and time consuming, while there may be plenty of labeled data in a related but different domain. Traditional text classification approaches are not able to cope well with learning across different domains. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain text classification algorithm which extends the traditional probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) algorithm to integrate labeled and unlabeled data, which come from different but related domains, into a unified probabilistic model. We call this new model Topic-bridged PLSA, or TPLSA. By exploiting the common topics between two domains, we transfer knowledge across different domains through a topic-bridge to help the text classification in the target domain. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to maximally mine knowledge that can be transferred between domains, resulting in superior performance when compared to other state-of-the-art text classification approaches. Experimental evaluation on different kinds of datasets shows that our proposed algorithm can improve the performance of cross-domain text classification significantly.

16750;"End-user assisted ontology evolution in uncertain domains";0;"Scharrenbach, T.";"Learning ontologies from large text corpora is a well understood task while evolving ontologies dynamically from user-input has rarely been adressed so far. Evolution of ontologies has to deal with vague or incomplete information. Accordingly, the formalism used for knowledge representation must be able to handle this kind of information. Classical logical approaches such as description logics are particularly poor in adressing uncertainty. Ontology evolution may benefit from exploring probabilistic or fuzzy approaches to knowledge representation. In this thesis an approach to evolve and update ontologies is developed which uses explicit and implicit user-input and extends probabilistic approaches to ontology engineering.

16754;"Multi-label literature classification based on the Gene Ontology graph";0;"Jin, B.a  and Muller, B.a  and Zhai, C.b  and Lu, X.a ";"Background: The Gene Ontology is a controlled vocabulary for representing knowledge related to genes and proteins in a computable form. The current effort of manually annotating proteins with the Gene Ontology is outpaced by the rate of accumulation of biomedical knowledge in literature, which urges the development of text mining approaches to facilitate the process by automatically extracting the Gene Ontology annotation from literature. The task is usually cast as a text classification problem, and contemporary methods are confronted with unbalanced training data and the difficulties associated with multi-label classification. Results: In this research, we investigated the methods of enhancing automatic multi-label classification of biomedical literature by utilizing the structure of the Gene Ontology graph. We have studied three graph-based multi-label classification algorithms, including a novel stochastic algorithm and two top-down hierarchical classification methods for multi-label literature classification. We systematically evaluated and compared these graph-based classification algorithms to a conventional flat multi-label algorithm. The results indicate that, through utilizing the information from the structure of the Gene Ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods can significantly improve predictions of the Gene Ontology terms implied by the analyzed text. Furthermore, the graph-based multi-label classifiers are capable of suggesting Gene Ontology annotations (to curators) that are closely related to the true annotations even if they fail to predict the true ones directly. A software package implementing the studied algorithms is available for the research community. Conclusion: Through utilizing the information from the structure of the Gene Ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods have better potential than the conventional flat multi-label classification approach to facilitate protein annotation based on the literature.

16765;"Contents modelling of neo-sumerian ur III economic text corpus";0;"Jaworski, W.";"This paper describes a system for processing economic documents written in the ancient Sumerian language. The system is application-oriented and takes advantage of the simplicity of ancient economy. We have developed an ontology for a selected branch of economic activities. We translate the documents into a meaning representation language by means of a semantic grammar. The meaning representation language is constructed in a way that allows us to handle massive ambiguity caused by: the specifics of the Sumerian writing system (signs polyvalence, lack of mid-word signs), our incomplete knowledge of the Sumerian language and frequent damages of documents. The system is augmented with the capability of processing documents whose parts describe concepts not included in the ontology and grammar. As an effect we obtain a structural description of the documents contents in the meaning representation language, ready to use in historical research.

The vectors obtained after dimensionality and volume reduction steps are used to train the document maps with the SOM algorithm, thus the training time is reduced without compromising the quality of the generated map. We compare experimentally the hybrid system with the correspondent SOM system in organization of documents of Reuters-21758 v1.0 collection. The performances of the systems were measured in terms of classification error in text categorization and training time. The experimental results show that the proposed system generates pretty good document maps with smallest training time.

Recently, new research approaches have been defined in order to automatically extract such opinions from the Internet. They usually consider opinions to be expressed through adjectives, and make extensive use of either general dictionaries or experts to provide the relevant adjectives. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from the following drawback: in a specific domain, a given adjective may either not exist or have a different meaning from another domain. In this paper, we propose a new approach focusing on two steps. First, we automatically extract a learning dataset for a specific domain from the Internet. Secondly, from this learning set we extract the set of positive and negative adjectives relevant to the domain. The usefulness of our approach was demonstrated by experiments performed on real data.

16781;"Query suggestion using hitting time";0;"Mei, Q.a  and Zhou, D.b  and Church, K.a ";"Generating alternative queries, also known as query suggestion, has long been proved useful to help a user explore and express his information need. In many scenarios, such suggestions can be generated from a large scale graph of queries and other accessory information, such as the clickthrough. However, how to generate suggestions while ensuring their semantic consistency with the original query remains a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a novel query suggestion algorithm based on ranking queries with the hitting time on a large scale bipartite graph. Without involvement of twisted heuristics or heavy tuning of parameters, this method clearly captures the semantic consistency between the suggested query and the original query. Empirical experiments on a large scale query log of a commercial search engine and a scientific literature collection show that hitting time is effective to generate semantically consistent query suggestions. The proposed algorithm and its variations can successfully boost long tail queries, accommodating personalized query suggestion, as well as finding related authors in research.

16783;"Modeling hidden topics on document manifold";0;"Cai, D. and Mei, Q. and Han, J. and Zhai, C.";"Topic modeling has been a key problem for document analysis. One of the canonical approaches for topic modeling is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing, which maximizes the joint probability of documents and terms in the corpus. The major disadvantage of PLSI is that it estimates the probability distribution of each document on the hidden topics independently and the number of parameters in the model grows linearly with the size of the corpus, which leads to serious problems with overfitting. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is proposed to overcome this problem by treating the probability distribution of each document over topics as a hidden random variable. Both of these two methods discover the hidden topics in the Euclidean space. However, there is no convincing evidence that the document space is Euclidean, or flat. Therefore, it is more natural and reasonable to assume that the document space is a manifold, either linear or nonlinear. In this paper, we consider the problem of topic modeling on intrinsic document manifold. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm called Laplacian Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (LapPLSI) for topic modeling. LapPLSI models the document space as a submanifold embedded in the ambient space and directly performs the topic modeling on this document manifold in question. We compare the proposed LapPLSI approach with PLSI and LDA on three text data sets. Experimental results show that LapPLSI provides better representation in the sense of semantic structure.

16784;"Applying semantic web into technology forecasting in enterprises";0;"Tang, F.a  and Liu, Y.b ";"When massive information is available for technology forecasting activities in WWW and other internet services, the smart technology forecasting supported by text-mining and other information technologies becomes one of the new approaches of technology forecasting. However, it is difficult to avoid the problems of confusion of information, disguise, and invalidation of correlation weighing when current text mining techniques based on keyword search are employed to conduct technology forecasting. In this paper, we present a three-layer model of smart technology forecasting based on text mining consisting of the collection layer, the analysis layer and the representation layer.

16793;"Using wikipedia for co-clustering based cross-domain text classification";0;"Wang, P.a  and Domeniconi, C.a  and Hu, J.b ";"Traditional approaches to document classification requires labeled data in order to construct reliable and accurate classifiers. Unfortunately, labeled data are seldom available, and often too expensive to obtain. Given a learning task for which training data are not available, abundant labeled data may exist for a different but related domain. One would like to use the related labeled data as auxiliary information to accomplish the classification task in the target domain. Recently, the paradigm of transfer learning has been introduced to enable effective learning strategies when auxiliary data obey a different probability distribution. A co-clustering based classification algorithm has been previously proposed to tackle cross-domain text classification. In this work, we extend the idea underlying this approach by making the latent semantic relationship between the two domains explicit. This goal is achieved with the use of Wikipedia. As a result, the pathway that allows to propagate labels between the two domains not only captures common words, but also semantic concepts based on the content of documents. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our semantic-based approach to cross-domain classification using a variety of real data.

Most of existing text clustering algorithm which derived from traditional formatted data clustering heavily rely on term analysis methods and adopted Vector Space Model (VSM) as their document representation. But because of the essential characteristic underlying text such as high dimensionality features vector space, the problem of sparseness has a strong impact on the clustering algorithm. So feature reduction is an important preprocess step for improving the efficiency and accuracy of clustering algorithm by removing redundant and irrelevant terms from corpus. Even the clustering is considered as an unsupervised learning method, but in text, there is still some priori knowledge we can use from NLP analysis based approach. In this paper, we propose a semantic analysis based feature reduction method which used in Chinese text clustering. Our method bases on a dedicated Part-of-Speech tags selection and synonyms consolidation and can reduce the feature space of documents more effectively compared with traditional feature reduction method tfidf and stopwords removal; meanwhile it preserves or sometimes even improves the accuracy of clustering algorithm. In our experiment, we tested our feature reduction method using bisecting k-means algorithm which was proved be efficient in text clustering. The results show that our method can reduce the feature space significantly, and meanwhile have a better clustering accuracy in terms of the purity.

The approach presented in this paper applies supervision using active learning. We first utilize Wikipedia to create a concept-based representation of a text document, with each concept associated to a Wikipedia article. We then exploit the semantic relatedness between Wikipedia concepts to find pair-wise instance-level constraints for supervised clustering, guiding clustering towards the direction indicated by the constraints. We test our approach on three standard text document datasets.

We investigate the traditional indexing methods as TF*IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) and LSI (latent semantic indexing) for comparative study. The performances of TF*IDF, LSI and multiword are examined on the tasks of text classification, which includes information retrieval (IR) and text categorization (TC), in Chinese and English document collection respectively. We also attempt to tune the rescaling factor of LSI and observe its effectiveness in text classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TF*IDF and multi-word are comparable when they are used for IR and TC and LSI is the poorest one of them.

The general feeling is that dealing explicitly with only semantic information does not improve significantly the performance of text retrieval systems. This paper presents SENSE (SEmantic N-levels Search Engine), an IR system that tries to overcome the limitations of the ranked keyword approach, by introducing semantic levels which integrate (and not simply replace) the lexical level represented by keywords.

Recently, topic models for processing hypertexts such as web pages were also proposed. The proposed hypertext models are generative models giving rise to both words and hyperlinks. This paper points out that to better represent the contents of hypertexts it is more essential to assume that the hyperlinks are fixed and to define the topic model as that of generating words only. The paper then proposes a new topic model for hypertext processing, referred to as Hypertext Topic Model (HTM). HTM defines the distribution of words in a document (i.e., the content of the document) as a mixture over latent topics in the document itself and latent topics in the documents which the document cites. The topics are further characterized as distributions of words, as in the conventional topic models. This paper further proposes a method for learning the HTM model.

16820;"Facts from text: Can text mining help to scale-up high-quality manual curation of gene products with ontologies?";0;"Winnenburg, R. and WÃ¤chter, T. and Plake, C. and Doms, A. and Schroeder, M.";"The biomedical literature can be seen as a large integrated, but unstructured data repository. Extracting facts from literature and making them accessible is approached from two directions: manual curation efforts develop ontologies and vocabularies to annotate gene products based on statements in papers. Text mining aims to automatically identify entities and their relationships in text using information retrieval and natural language processing techniques. Manual curation is highly accurate but time consuming, and does not scale with the ever increasing growth of literature. Text mining as a high-throughput computational technique scales well, but is error-prone due to the complexity of natural language. How can both be married to combine scalability and accuracy? Here, we review the state-of-the-art text mining approaches that are relevant to annotation and discuss available online services analysing biomedical literature by means of text mining techniques, which could also be utilised by annotation projects. We then examine how far text mining has already been utilised in existing annotation projects and conclude how these techniques could be tightly integrated into the manual annotation process through novel authoring systems to scale-up high-quality manual curation.

Ontology learning workbenches are used for semi-automatic learning of ontologies from representative text collections. This paper presents a new interactive workbench that gives the users more freedom in their ontology engineering process and frees them from knowing any ontology language syntax. The workbench is implemented as part of a search project, in which ontologies are used to search for movie information on the web.

16826;"An effective term weighting method using random walk model for text classification";0;"Islam, M.R. and Islam, M.R.";"Text classification may be viewed as assigning texts in a predefined set of categories. However there are many digital documents that are not organized according to their contents. So it is difficult task to find relevant documents for a user. Automatic text classification problem can solve this problem. In this paper we introduce a new random walk term weighting method for improved text classification. In our approach to weight a term, we exploit the relationship of local (term position, term frequency) and global (inverse document frequency, information gain) information of terms (vertices). Moreover, we weight terms by considering co-occurrence and semantic relation of terms as a measure of dependency. To evaluate our term weighting approach we integrate it in Rocchio text classification algorithm and experimental results show that our method performs better than other random walk models.

16830;"Kernel methods, syntax and semantics for relational text categorization";0;"Moschitti, A.";"Previous work on Natural Language Processing for Information Retrieval has shown the inadequateness of semantic and syntactic structures for both document retrieval and categorization. The main reason is the high reliability and effectiveness of language models, which are sufficient to accurately solve such retrieval tasks. However, when the latter involve the computation of relational semantics between text fragments simple statistical models may result ineffective. In this paper, we show that syntactic and semantic structures can be used to greatly improve complex categorization tasks such as determining if an answer correctly responds to a question. Given the high complexity of representing semantic/syntactic structures in learning algorithms, we applied kernel methods along with Support Vector Machines to better exploit the needed relational information. Our experiments on answer classification on Web and TREC data show that our models greatly improve on bagof-words.

It is aimed at discovering semantic knowledge about words in particular domains, which has become increasingly important with the growing use of text mining, information retrieval, and speech recognition. The subject-predicate structure is taken as a syntactic structure with the noun as the subject and the verb as the predicate. This structure is regarded as a graph structure. The generation of this graph can be modeled using the hierarchical Dirichlet process and the Pitman-Yor process. The probabilistic generative model we developed for this graph structure consists of subject-predicate structures extracted from a corpus. Evaluation of this model by measuring the performance of graph clustering based on WordNet similarities demonstrated that it outperforms other baseline models.

Furthermore, some verbs will not be mentioned at all in such a dictionary, since they are too area specific.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called Learning Latent Semantics for Ranking (LLSR), to seek the optimal Latent Semantic Space tailored to the ranking tasks. We first present a dual explanation for the classical Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) algorithm, namely learning the so-called Latent Semantic Space (LSS) to encode the data information. Then, to handle the increasing amount of training data for the practical ranking tasks, we propose a novel objective function to derive the optimal LSS for ranking. Experimental results on two SMART sub-collections and a TREC dataset show that LLSR effectively improves the ranking performance compared with the classical LSI algorithm and ranking without subspace learning.

The basic BPNN learning algorithm has the drawback of slow training speed, so we modify the basic BPNN learning algorithm to accelerate the training speed. The categorization accuracy also has been improved consequently. Traditional word-matching based text categorization system uses vector space model (VSM) to represent the document. However, it needs a high dimensional space to represent the document, and does not take into account the semantic relationship between terms, which can also lead to poor classification accuracy. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) can overcome the problems caused by using statistically derived conceptual indices instead of individual words. It constructs a conceptual vector space in which each term or document is represented as a vector in the space. It not only greatly reduces the dimensionality but also discovers the important associative relationship between terms. We test our categorization models on 20-newsgroup data set, experimental results show that the models using MBPNN outperform than the basic BPNN. And the application of LSA for our system can lead to dramatic dimensionality reduction while achieving good classification results. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

16855;"Genic interaction extraction by reasoning on an ontology";0;"Manine, A.-P.a  and Alphonse, E.a  and Bessieres, P.b ";"Information Extraction (IE) systems have been proposed in recent years, to extract genic interactions from bibliographical resources. But they are limited to single interaction relations, and have to face a tradeoff between recall and precision, by focusing either on specific interactions (for precision), or general and unspecified interactions of biological entities (for recall). Yet, biologists need to process more complex data from literature, in order to study biological pathways, so an ontology is an adequate formal representation to model this sophisticated knowledge. But the tight integration of IE systems and ontologies is still a current research issue, a fortiori with complex ones that go beyond hierarchies. Here, we propose a rich modeling of genic interactions with an ontology, and show how it can be used within an IE system. The ontology is seen as a language specifying a normalized representation of text. IE is performed by first extracting instances from Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules, then deductive inferences on the ontology language are completed. New instances may be infered, bringing together otherwise scattered textual information. We validated our approach on an annotated corpus of gene transcription regulations in Bacillus subtilis.

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic keyphrase extraction algorithm using semantic features mined from online Wikipedia. This algorithm first identifies candidate keyphrases based on lexical methods, and then a semantic graph which connects candidate keyphrases with document topics is constructed. Afterwards, a link analysis algorithm is applied to assign semantic feature weight to the candidate keyphrases. Finally, several statistical and semantic features are assembled by a regression model to predict the quality of candidates. Encouraging results are achieved in our experiments which show the effectiveness of our method.

By considering ontology attributes we are able to improve the semantic representation of a sentences information content. The classifier that maps sentences to the taxonomy is trained using search engines and is therefore very flexible and not bound to a specific domain.

A corpus of clinical notes (n=309) was collected and annotated using the two schemas. The annotations were coded for a decision tree classifier for text classification task. The standard information retrieval measures of precision, recall, f-score and accuracy and the paired t-test were used for evaluation. Results: The performance of S-Model was better than the original T-Model (p<0.05 for recall and f-score).

However, useful socio-semantic data can be retrieved from a chat conversation using ontology-based text mining techniques. In this paper, a novel approach for detecting several kinds of semantic data from a chat conversation is presented. This method uses a combination of a dialogistic, socio-cultural perspective and of classical knowledge-based text processing methods. Lexical and domain ontologies are used. A tool has been developed for the discovery of the most important topics and of the contribution of each participant in the conversation. The system also discovers new, implicit references among the utterances of the chat in order to offer a multi-voiced representation of the conversation. The application offers a panel for visualizing the threading of the subjects in the chat and the contributions function.

16871;"An intelligent system for semantic information retrieval information from textual web documents";0;"Karthik, M.a  and Marikkannan, M.b  and Kannan, A.a ";"Text data, which are represented as free text in World Wide Web (WWW), are inherently unstructured and hence it becomes difficult to directly process the text data by computer programs. There has been great interest in text mining techniques recently for helping users to quickly gain knowledge from the Web. Text mining technologies usually involve tasks such as text refining which transforms free text into an intermediate representation form which is machine-processable and knowledge distillation which deduces patterns or knowledge from the intermediate form. These text representation methodologies consider documents as bags of words and ignore the meanings and ideas their authors want to convey. As terms are treated as individual items in such simplistic representations, terms lose their semantic relations and texts lose their original meanings. In this paper, we propose a system that overcomes the limitations of the existing technologies to retrieve the information from the knowledge discovered through data mining based on the detailed meanings of the text. For this, we propose a Knowledge representation technique, which uses Resources Description Framework (RDF) metadata to represent the semantic relations, which are extracted from textual web document using natural language processing techniques. The main objective of the creation of RDF metadata in this system is to have flexibility for easy retrieval of the semantic information effectively. We also propose an effective SEMantic INformation RETrieval algorithm called SEMINRET algorithm. The experimental results obtained from this system show that the computations of Precision and Recall in RDF databases are highly accurate when compared to XML databases. Moreover, it is observed from our experiments that the document retrieval from the RDF database is more efficient than the document retrieval using XML databases.

Today, due to the extremely large number of information sources, automatic mechanisms are needed to filter the information that could be useful for each user. However, one of the problems that the usual techniques of automatic text categorization have not been able to handle is polysemy (words with two o more senses). In this paper, we have faced this problem by proposing a semantic analyzer for the automatic categorization of texts in Spanish. Context exploration techniques were used as a key mechanism for guiding the disambiguation process. A specific lexical database and its existing semantic relations fulfilled the objective of appropriately categorizing the analyzed text. To validate this analyzer, a tool was developed that classifies web pages by semantic sense. We present performance results for this classifier.

16884;"A platform framework for cross-lingual text relatedness evaluation and plagiarism detection";0;"Lee, C.-H.a  and Wu, C.-H.a  and Yang, H.-C.b ";"Research work related to plagiarism detection methods in dealing with monolingual texts (e.g. English texts) have been well established in recent years. However, little attention has been paid to facilitate plagiarism detection in cross-lingual text collections (e.g. English and Chinese texts). In this paper we present a system platform to evaluating text similarity and relatedness in multilingual text collections for plagiarism detection. First, we utilized a number of selected texts in Chinese-English parallel corpora collected from internet to train text classifiers based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model. As such, the multilingual texts of unknown category can be classified by the trained classifiers. Subsequently, the resulting categorized texts were measured by means of a language-neutral clustering technique based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method for evaluating semantic similarity among texts. The preliminary results show that our platform framework has the potential for cross-lingual text relatedness evaluation and plagiarism detection.

16888;"Wikipedia in action: Ontological knowledge in text categorization";0;"Janik, M. and Kochut, K.J.";"We present a new, ontology-based approach to the automatic text categorization. An important and novel aspect of this approach is that our categorization method does not require a training set, which is in contrast to the traditional statistical and probabilistic methods. In the presented method, the ontology, including the domain concepts organized into hierarchies of categories and interconnected by relationships, as well as instances and connections among them, effectively becomes the classifier. Our method focuses on (i) converting a text document into a thematic graph of entities occurring in the document, (ii) ontological classification of the entities in the graph, and (iii) determining the overall categorization of the thematic graph, and as a result, the document itself. In the presented experiments, we used an RDF ontology constructed from the full English version of Wikipedia. Our experiments, conducted on corpora of Reuters news articles, showed that our training-less categorization method achieved a very good overall accuracy.

Since the late 90s we have been building knowledge resources to support these tasks. Over the years, we have gathered valuable experience by running various applications and by discussing with our scientists from different areas. Based on this experience, we are currently enhancing the content of our terminologies as well as the conceptual structures to represent cross-references. In the biomedical domain, there are long standing efforts to formally conceive knowledge repositories. With the era of the Semantic Web, a limited number of frameworks have achieved acceptance in the community aiming at semantic interoperability. Inspired by the knowledge engineering approaches in biomedicine, we propose a unified conceptual model for knowledge representation and its implementation. Contrary to the widespread frameworks, our model excels in its modularity.

Sentiment classification requires the knowledge data of vocabularies semantic meaning and the relationships between the vocabularies. In this paper, sentiment features of text were divided into characteristic words and phrases, which were extracted from the training data. The method combining HowNet with sentiment classifier was proposed. It computed semantic similarity of characteristic words, phrases with tagged words in HowNet, and it adopted the positive and negative terms as features of sentiment classifier. In the test, a sentiment classifier was designed to compare with the other methods. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of our method.

In this study, we compared several feature representations for affect analysis, including learned n-grams and various automatically and manually crafted affect lexicons. We also proposed the support vector regression correlation ensemble (SVRCE) method for enhanced classification of affect intensities. SVRCE uses an ensemble of classifiers each trained using a feature subset tailored toward classifying a single affect class. The ensemble is combined with affect correlation information to enable better prediction of emotive intensities. Experiments were conducted on four test beds encompassing web forums, blogs, and online stories. The results revealed that learned n-grams were more effective than lexicon-based affect representations. The findings also indicated that SVRCE outperformed comparison techniques, including Pace regression, semantic orientation, and WordNet models. Ablation testing showed that the improved performance of SVRCE was attributable to its use of feature ensembles as well as affect correlation information.

Text visualization is a key component in visual text analytics. While the term ""text visualization"" has been used to describe a variety of methods for visualizing both structured and unstructured characteristics of text-based data, it is most closely associated with techniques for depicting the semantic characteristics of the free-text components of documents in large document collections. In contrast with text clustering techniques which serve only to partition text corpora into sets of related items, these so-called semantic mapping methods also typically strive to depict detailed inter- and intra-set similarity structure. Text analytics software typically couples semantic mapping techniques with additional visualization techniques to enable interactive comparison of semantic structure with other characteristics of the information, such as publication date or citation information. In this way, value can be derived from the material in the form of multidimensional relationship patterns existing among the discrete items in the collection. The ultimate goal of these techniques is to enable human understanding and reasoning about the contents of large and complexly related text collections.

16918;"Semantic and syntactic features for Dutch coreference resolution";0;"Hendrickx, I.a  and Hoste, V.b  and Daelemans, W.a ";"We investigate the effect of encoding additional semantic and syntactic information sources in a classification-based machine learning approach to the task of coreference resolution for Dutch. We experiment both with a memory-based learning approach and a maximum entropy modeling method. As an alternative to using external lexical resources, such as the low-coverage Dutch EuroWordNet, we evaluate the effect of automatically generated semantic clusters as information source. We compare these clusters, which group together semantically similar nouns, to two semantic features based on EuroWordNet encoding synonym and hypernym relations between nouns. The syntactic function of the anaphor and antecedent in the sentence can be an important clue for resolving coreferential relations. As baseline approach, we encode syntactic information as predicted by a memory-based shallow parser in a set of features. We contrast these shallow parse based features with features encoding richer syntactic information from a dependency parser. We show that using both the additional semantic information and syntactic information lead to small but significant performance improvement of our coreference resolution approach.

16919;"Layer structures and conceptual hierarchies in semantic representations for NLP";0;"Helbig, H. and GlÃ¶ckner, I. and Osswald, R.";"Knowledge representation systems aiming at full natural language understanding need to cover a wide range of semantic phenomena including lexical ambiguities, coreference, modalities, counterfactuals, and generic sentences. In order to achieve this goal, we argue for a multidimensional view on the representation of natural language semantics. The proposed approach, which has been successfully applied to various NLP tasks including text retrieval and question answering, tries to keep the balance between expressiveness and manageability by introducing separate semantic layers for capturing dimensions such as facticity, degree of generalization, and determination of reference. Layer specifications are also used to express the distinction between categorical and situational knowledge and the encapsulation of knowledge needed e.g. for a proper modeling of propositional attitudes. The paper describes the role of these classificational means for natural language understanding, knowledge representation, and reasoning, and exemplifies their use in NLP applications.

16920;"Natural language as the basis for meaning representation and inference";0;"Dagan, I.a  and Bar-Haim, R.a  and Szpektor, I.a  and Greental, I.b  and Shnarch, E.a ";"Semantic inference is an important component in many natural language understanding applications. Classical approaches to semantic inference rely on logical representations for meaning, which may be viewed as being ""external"" to the natural language itself. However, practical applications usually adopt shallower lexical or lexical-syntactic representations, which correspond closely to language structure. In many cases, such approaches lack a principled meaning representation and inference framework. We describe a generic semantic inference framework that operates directly on language-based structures, particularly syntactic trees. New trees are inferred by applying entailment rules, which provide a unified representation for varying types of inferences. Rules were generated by manual and automatic methods, covering generic linguistic structures as well as specific lexical-based inferences. Initial empirical evaluation in a Relation Extraction setting supports the validity and potential of our approach. Additionally, such inference is shown to improve the critical step of unsupervised learning of entailment rules, which in turn enhances the scope of the inference system.

16926;"Recommending software artifacts from repository transactions";0;"David, J.";"The central problem addressed by this interdisciplinary paper is to predict related software artifacts that are usually changed together by a developer. The working focus of programmers is revealed by means of their interactions with a software repository that receives a set of cohesive artifact changes within one commit transaction. This implicit knowledge of interdependent changes can be exploited in order to recommend likely further changes, given a set of already changed artifacts. We suggest a hybrid approach based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and machine learning methods to recommend software development artifacts, that is predicting a sequence of configuration items that were committed together. As opposed to related approaches to repository mining that are mostly based on symbolic methods like Association Rule Mining (ARM), our connectionist method is able to generalize onto unseen artifacts. Text analysis methods are employed to consider their textual attributes. We applied our technique to three publicly available datasets from the PROMISE Repository of Software Engineering Databases. The evaluation showed that the connectionist LSI-approach achieves a significantly higher recommendation accuracy than existing methods based on ARM. Even when generalizing onto unseen artifacts, our approach still provides an accuracy of up to 72.7% on the given datasets.

During this process, SOPHIA-TCBR automatically discovers appropriate case and similarity knowledge. It then is able to organize the cases within each cluster by forming a minimum spanning tree, based on their semantic similarity. SOPHIAs capability as a case-based text classifier is benchmarked against the well known and widely utilised k-Means approach. Results show that SOPHIA either equals or outperforms k-Means based on 2 different case-bases, and as such is an attractive approach for case-based classification. We demonstrate the quality of the knowledge discovery process by showing the high level of topic similarity between adjacent cases within the minimum spanning tree. We show that the formation of the minimum spanning tree makes it possible to identify a kernel region within the cluster, which has a higher level of similarity between cases than the cluster in its entirety, and that this corresponds directly to a higher level of topic homogeneity. We demonstrate that the topic homogeneity increases as the average semantic similarity between cases in the kernel increases. Finally having empirically demonstrated the quality of the knowledge discovery process in SOPHIA, we show how it can be competently applied to case-based retrieval. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Effective utilization of this enormous repository means a need for tools and systems that support users in a process of finding documents related to their interests. For a human, a process of finding relevant documents is performed based on a network of interconnected and mutually dependent concepts and keywords. Concepts defined with keywords, words, or other concepts are part of the network. An ontology is a partially ordered set of concepts representing a specific domain. An ontology defined in the framework of the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee, Hendler, & Lassila, 2001) allows for specification of definitions of concepts, their instances, and a variety of relationships between concepts. Among various forms of knowledge representation, a hierarchy of concepts (Yager, 2000) is of a special interest. Graph-like structures of hierarchies provide a means for defining connections representing different dependencies between concepts.

And Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a well known technique in Information Retrieval, especially in dealing with polysemy (one word can have different meanings) and synonymy (different words are used to describe the same concept), but it is not an optimal representation for text classification. It always drops the text classification performance when being applied to the whole training set (global LSI) because this completely unsupervised method ignores class discrimination while only concentrating on representation. Some local LSI methods have been proposed to improve the classification by utilizing class discrimination information. However, their performance improvements over original term vectors are still very limited. In this paper, we propose a new local Latent Semantic Indexing method called ""Local Relevancy Ladder-Weighted LSI"" to improve text classification. And separate matrix singular value decomposition (SVD) was used to reduce the dimension of the vector space on the transformed local region of each class. Experimental results show that our method is much better than global LSI and traditional local LSI methods on classification within a much smaller LSI dimension.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to ranking individual members of a real-world communication network in terms of their roles in such propagation processes. We first improve the accuracy of the centrality measures by incorporating temporal attributes. Then, we integrate weighted PageRank and centrality scores to further improve the quality of these measures. We valid these ranking measures through a study of an email archive of a W3C working group against an independent list of experts. The results show that time-sensitive Degree, time-sensitive Betweenness and the integration of the weighted PageRank and these centrality measures yield the best ranking results. Our approach partially solves the rank sink problem of PageRank by adjusting flexible jumping probabilities with Betweenness centrality scores. Finally the text analysis based on Latent Semantic Indexing extracts key concepts distributed in different time frames and explores the evolution of the discussion topics in the social network.

16951;"Terminologies for text-mining; an experiment in the lipoprotein metabolism domain";0;"Alexopoulou, D.a  and WÃ¤chter, T.a  and Pickersgill, L.b  and Eyre, C.c  and Schroeder, M.a ";"Background: The engineering of ontologies, especially with a view to a text-mining use, is still a new research field. There does not yet exist a well-defined theory and technology for ontology construction. Many of the ontology design steps remain manual and are based on personal experience and intuition. However, there exist a few efforts on automatic construction of ontologies in the form of extracted lists of terms and relations between them. Results: We share experience acquired during the manual development of a lipoprotein metabolism ontology (LMO) to be used for text-mining. We compare the manually created ontology terms with the automatically derived terminology from four different automatic term recognition (ATR) methods. The top 50 predicted terms contain up to 89% relevant terms. For the top 1000 terms the best method still generates 51% relevant terms. In a corpus of 3066 documents 53% of LMO terms are contained and 38% can be generated with one of the methods. Conclusions: Given high precision, automatic methods can help decrease development time and provide significant support for the identification of domain-specific vocabulary. The coverage of the domain vocabulary depends strongly on the underlying documents. Ontology development for text mining should be performed in a semi-automatic way; taking ATR results as input and following the guidelines we described.

16952;"Extraction of semantic biomedical relations from text using conditional random fields";0;"Bundschus, M.a  b  and Dejori, M.b  c  and Stetter, M.b  and Tresp, V.b  and Kriegel, H.-P.a ";"Background: The increasing amount of published literature in biomedicine represents an immense source of knowledge, which can only efficiently be accessed by a new generation of automated information extraction tools. Named entity recognition of well-defined objects, such as genes or proteins, has achieved a sufficient level of maturity such that it can form the basis for the next step: the extraction of relations that exist between the recognized entities. Whereas most early work focused on the mere detection of relations, the classification of the type of relation is also of great importance and this is the focus of this work. In this paper we describe an approach that extracts both the existence of a relation and its type. Our work is based on Conditional Random Fields, which have been applied with much success to the task of named entity recognition. Results: We benchmark our approach on two different tasks. The first task is the identification of semantic relations between diseases and treatments. The available data set consists of manually annotated PubMed abstracts. The second task is the identification of relations between genes and diseases from a set of concise phrases, so-called GeneRIF (Gene Reference Into Function) phrases. In our experimental setting, we do not assume that the entities are given, as is often the case in previous relation extraction work. Rather the extraction of the entities is solved as a subproblem. Compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, we achieve very competitive results on both data sets. To demonstrate the scalability of our solution, we apply our approach to the complete human GeneRIF database. The resulting gene-disease network contains 34758 semantic associations between 4939 genes and 1745 diseases. The gene-disease network is publicly available as a machine-readable RDF graph. Conclusion: We extend the framework of Conditional Random Fields towards the annotation of semantic relations from text and apply it to the biomedical domain. Our approach is based on a rich set of textual features and achieves a performance that is competitive to leading approaches. The model is quite general and can be extended to handle arbitrary biological entities and relation types. The resulting gene-disease network shows that the GeneRIF database provides a rich knowledge source for text mining. Current work is focused on improving the accuracy of detection of entities as well as entity boundaries, which will also greatly improve the relation extraction performance.

16954;"Integrating structure and meaning: A new method for encoding structure for text classification";0;"Fishbein, J.M.a  and Eliasmith, C.a  b ";"Current representation schemes for automatic text classification treat documents as syntactically unstructured collections of words or concepts. Past attempts to encode syntactic structure have treated part-of-speech information as another word-like feature, but have been shown to be less effective than non-structural approaches. We propose a new representation scheme using Holographic Reduced Representations (HRRs) as a technique to encode both semantic and syntactic structure. This method improves on previous attempts in the literature by encoding the structure across all features of the document vector while preserving text semantics. Our method does not increase the dimensionality of the document vectors, allowing for efficient computation and storage. We present classification results of our HRR text representations versus Bag-of-Concepts representations and show that our method of including structure improves text classification results.

16955;"Exploiting and integrating rich features for biological literature classification";0;"Wang, H. and Huang, M. and Ding, S. and Zhu, X.";"Background: Efficient features play an important role in automated text classification, which definitely facilitates the access of large-scale data. In the bioscience field, biological structures and terminologies are described by a large number of features; domain dependent features would significantly improve the classification performance. How to effectively select and integrate different types of features to improve the biological literature classification performance is the major issue studied in this paper. Results: To efficiently classify the biological literatures, we propose a novel feature value schema TF*ML, features covering from lower level domain independent ""string feature"" to higher level domain dependent ""semantic template feature"", and proper integrations among the features. Compared to our previous approaches, the performance is improved in terms of AUC and F-Score by 11.5% and 8.8% respectively, and outperforms the best performance achieved in BioCreAtIvE 2006. Conclusions: Different types of features possess different discriminative capabilities in literature classification; proper integration of domain independent and dependent features would significantly improve the performance and overcome the over-fitting on data distribution.

16957;"Ontology-enhanced automatic chief complaint classification for syndromic surveillance";0;"Lu, H.-M.a  and Zeng, D.a  b  and Trujillo, L.c  and Komatsu, K.c  and Chen, H.a ";"Emergency department free-text chief complaints (CCs) are a major data source for syndromic surveillance. CCs need to be classified into syndromic categories for subsequent automatic analysis. However, the lack of a standard vocabulary and high-quality encodings of CCs hinder effective classification. This paper presents a new ontology-enhanced automatic CC classification approach. Exploiting semantic relations in a medical ontology, this approach is motivated to address the CC vocabulary variation problem in general and to meet the specific need for a classification approach capable of handling multiple sets of syndromic categories. We report an experimental study comparing our approach with two popular CC classification methods using a real-world dataset. This study indicates that our ontology-enhanced approach performs significantly better than the benchmark methods in terms of sensitivity, F measure, and F2 measure. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc.

16960;"Using incremental PLSI for threshold-resilient online event analysis";0;"Chou, T.-C. and Chen, M.C.";"The goal of online event analysis is to detect events and track their associated documents in real time from a continuous stream of documents generated by multiple information sources. Unlike traditional text categorization methods, event analysis approaches consider the temporal relations among documents. However, such methods suffer from the threshold-dependency problem, so they only perform well for a narrow range of thresholds. In addition, If the contents of a document stream change, the optimal threshold (that is, the threshold that yields the best performance) often changes as well. In this paper, we propose a threshold-resilient online algorithm, called the Incremental Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (IPLSI) algorithm, which alleviates the threshold-dependency problem and simultaneously maintains the continuity of the latent semantics to better capture the story line development of events. The IPLSI algorithm is theoretically sound and empirically efficient and effective for event analysis. The results of the performance evaluation performed on the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT)-4 corpus show that the algorithm reduces the cost of event analysis by as much as 15 percent âˆ¼20 percent and increases the acceptable threshold range by 200 percent to 300 percent over the baseline.

The unification processing for database attributes is to let the attribute labels that are closed semantically be replaced with delegates.

16971;"OpenDMAP: An open source, ontology-driven concept analysis engine, with applications to capturing knowledge regarding protein transport, protein interactions and cell-type-specific gene expression";0;"Hunter, L.a  and Lu, Z.b  and Firby, J.c  and Baumgartner Jr., W.A.a  and Johnson, H.L.a  and Ogren, P.V.d  and Cohen, K.B.a ";"Background: Information extraction (IE) efforts are widely acknowledged to be important in harnessing the rapid advance of biomedical knowledge, particularly in areas where important factual information is published in a diverse literature. Here we report on the design, implementation and several evaluations of OpenDMAP, an ontology-driven, integrated concept analysis system. It significantly advances the state of the art in information extraction by leveraging knowledge in ontological resources, integrating diverse text processing applications, and using an expanded pattern language that allows the mixing of syntactic and semantic elements and variable ordering. Results: OpenDMAP information extraction systems were produced for extracting protein transport assertions (transport), protein-protein interaction assertions (interaction) and assertions that a gene is expressed in a cell type (expression). Evaluations were performed on each system, resulting in F-scores ranging from .26 - .72 (precision .39 - .85, recall .16 - .85). Additionally, each of these systems was run over all abstracts in MEDLINE, producing a total of 72,460 transport instances, 265,795 interaction instances and 176,153 expression instances. Conclusion: OpenDMAP advances the performance standards for extracting protein-protein interaction predications from the full texts of biomedical research articles. Furthermore, this level of performance appears to generalize to other information extraction tasks, including extracting information about predicates of more than two arguments. The output of the information extraction system is always constructed from elements of an ontology, ensuring that the knowledge representation is grounded with respect to a carefully constructed model of reality. The results of these efforts can be used to increase the efficiency of manual curation efforts and to provide additional features in systems that integrate multiple sources for information extraction.

16975;"Clustering text data streams";0;"Liu, Y.-B.a  and Cai, J.-R.a  and Yin, J.a  and Fu, A.W.-C.b ";"Clustering text data streams is an important issue in data mining community and has a number of applications such as news group filtering, text crawling, document organization and topic detection and tracing etc. However, most methods are similarity-based approaches and only use the TF*IDF scheme to represent the semantics of text data and often lead to poor clustering quality. Recently, researchers argue that semantic smoothing model is more efficient than the existing TF*IDF scheme for improving text clustering quality. However, the existing semantic smoothing model is not suitable for dynamic text data context. In this paper, we extend the semantic smoothing model into text data streams context firstly. Based on the extended model, we then present two online clustering algorithms OCTS and OCTSM for the clustering of massive text data streams. In both algorithms, we also present a new cluster statistics structure named cluster profile which can capture the semantics of text data streams dynamically and at the same time speed up the clustering process. Some efficient implementations for our algorithms are also given. Finally, we present a series of experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of our technique.

16982;"Learning the semantic meaning of a concept from the web";0;"Yu, Y. and Peng, Y.";"Many researchers have used text classification method in solving the ontology mapping problem. Their mapping results heavily depend on the availability of quality exemplars used as training data. However, manual preparation of exemplars is costly. In this work, we propose to automatically extract text from web pages returned by a search engine. Search queries are formed according to the semantic information given in the ontology. We have implemented a prototype system that automates the entire process (from search query formation to conditional probability calculation) and conducted a series of experiments.

16987;"Text categorization for improved priors of word meaning";0;"Koeling, R. and McCarthy, D. and Carroll, J.";"Distributions of the senses of words are often highly skewed. This fact is exploited by word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems which back off to the predominant (most frequent) sense of a word when contextual clues are not strong enough. The topic domain of a document has a strong influence on the sense distribution of words. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to produce large manually sense-annotated corpora for every domain of interest. Previous experiments have shown that unsupervised estimation of the predominant sense of certain words using corpora whose domain has been determined by hand outperforms estimates based on domain-independent text for a subset of words and even outperforms the estimates based on counting occurrences in an annotated corpus. In this paper we address the question of whether we can automatically produce domain-specific corpora which could be used to acquire predominant senses appropriate for specific domains. We collect the corpora by automatically classifying documents from a very large corpus of newswire text. Using these corpora we estimate the predominant sense of words for each domain. We first compare with the results presented in [1]. Encouraged by the results we start exploring using text categorization for WSD by evaluating on a standard data set (documents from the SENSEVAL-2 and 3 English all-word tasks). We show that for these documents and using domain-specific predominant senses, we are able to improve on the results that we obtained with predominant senses estimated using general, non domain-specific text. We also show that the confidence of the text classifier is a good indication whether it is worth-while using the domain-specific predominant sense or not.

16989;"A concept-based model for enhancing text categorization";0;"Shehata, S. and Karray, F. and Kamel, M.";"Most of text categorization techniques are based on word and/or phrase analysis of the text. Statistical analysis of a term frequency captures the importance of the term within a document only. However, two terms can have the same frequency in their documents, but one term contributes moreto the meaning of its sentences than the other term. Thus, the underlying model should indicate terms that capture these mantics of text. In this case, the model can capture terms that present the concepts of the sentence, which leads to discover the topic of the document. A new concept-based model that analyzes terms on the sentence and document levels rather than the traditional analysis of document only is introduced. The concept-based model can effectively discriminate between non-important terms with respect to sentence semantics and terms which hold the concepts that represent the sentence meaning. The proposed model consists of concept-based statistical analyzer, conceptual ontological graph representation, and concept extractor. The term which contributes to the sentence semantics is assigned two different weights by the concept-based statistical analyzer and the conceptual ontological graph representation. These two weights are combined into a new weight. The concepts that have maximum combined weights are selected by the concept extractor. A set of experiments using the proposed concept-based model on different datasets in text categorization is conducted. The experiments demonstrate the comparison between traditional weighting and the concept-based weighting obtained by the combined approach of the concept-based statistical analyzer and the conceptual ontological graph. The evaluation of results is relied on two quality measures, the Macro-averaged F1 and the Error rate. These quality measures are improved when the newly developed concept-based model is used to enhance the quality of the text categorization.

16994;"Discovering user profiles from semantically indexed scientific papers";0;"Semeraro, G. and Basile, P. and De Gemmis, M. and Lops, P.";"Typically, personalized information recommendation services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. We present an approach based on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) for the extraction of user profiles from documents. This approach relies on a knowledge-based WSD algorithm, called JIGSAW, for the semantic indexing of documents: JIGSAW exploits the WordNet lexical database to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. Semantically indexed documents are used to train a naÃ¯ve Bayes learner that infers ""semantic"", sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes). Two empirical evaluations are described in the paper. In the first experimental session, JIGSAW has been evaluated according to the parameters of the SENSEVAL-3 initiative, that provides a forum where the WSD systems are assessed against disambiguated datasets. The goal of the second empirical evaluation has been to measure the accuracy of the user profiles in selecting relevant documents to be recommended. Performance of classical keyword-based profiles has been compared to that of sense-based profiles in the task of recommending scientific papers. The results show that sense-based profiles outperform keyword-based ones.

Recent success of language modeling in information retrieval have let us consider again about multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes for text classification. In this paper, we propose a semantic smoothing method for NaÃ¯ve Bayes model, biomedical documents were indexed by the concept of UMLS, and at the same time concept pairs which are context-sensitive were extracted as topic signature, the translation between concept pair and concept is attained using EM algorithm. Then classification model is estimated by a mixture model combined with this semantic smoothing method. Ontology-based document representation can deal with synonym and reduce the concept vector. The semantic smoothing method can partly solve the sparseness of data. Our method is evaluated on OHSUMED and genomic track collection, and proper results were attained. We found this semantic smoothing method can attain better results than other simple smoothing method, also this method is significant because of its simpleness, comprehensibility.

The successful application of machine learning techniques for learning of ontologies from textual data, i.e. mining for the Semantic Web, contributes to this trend. However, no principal approaches exist so far for mining from the Semantic Web. We investigate how machine learning algorithms can be made amenable for directly taking advantage of the rich knowledge expressed in ontologies and associated instance data. Kernel methods have been successfully employed in various learning tasks and provide a clean framework for interfacing between non-vectorial data and machine learning algorithms. In this spirit, we express the problem of mining instances in ontologies as the problem of defining valid corresponding kernels. We present a principled framework for designing such kernels by means of decomposing the kernel computation into specialized kernels for selected characteristics of an ontology which can be flexibly assembled and tuned.

Firstly, a text is represented as a rough undirected weighted semantic graph with WordNet, which defines synsets as vertices and relations of vertices as edges, and assigns the weight of edges with the relatedness of connected synsets. Then we apply UW-PageRank in the rough graph to do word sense disambiguation, prune the graph, and finally apply UW-PageRank again on the pruned graph to extract keywords.

Our main idea consists in finding a series of projections of the training data by using a new, modified LSI algorithm, projecting all training instances to the low-dimensional subspace found in the previous step, and finally inducing a binary search on the projected low-dimensional data.

17013;"Language feature mining for document subjectivity analysis";0;"Chen, B. and He, H. and Guo, J.";"In recent years, document sentiment analysis has attracted a great deal of research interest. One important aspect of this filed is the subjectivity analysis. This problem is different from traditional text categorization on that more linguistic or semantic information are required for better estimating the subjectivity of a document. Therefore, in this paper, focuses are on how to extract useful and meaningful language features and how to combine all of these language features efficiently. Under the well-known ngram language model framework, we investigated a series of language-grams having different n-order and various distances to find the most important ones. In addition, we have also tried several weighting methods to make features more meaningful.

After working on several industrial applications (in particular, in the healthcare and life sciences area), we have identified fundamental issues and technical approaches to tackle the issues.

Building on a traditional web-based view of information from different legacy databases, we have performed a semantic porting of data into a knowledge base, dependent on an OWL domain ontology. We have enriched the knowledge base by means of text mining techniques, in order to discover on-topic relations. Several reasoning techniques have been applied, in order to infer relevant implicit relationships. Finally, the ontology and the knowledge base have been deployed on a semantic wiki by means of the WikiFactory tool, which allows users to browse the ontology and the knowledge base, to introduce new relations, to revise wrong assertions in a collaborative way, and to perform semantic queries. In our experiments, we have been able to easily implement several functionalities, such as expert finding, by simply formulating ad-hoc queries from either an ontology editor or the semantic wiki interface. The result is an intelligent and collaborative front end, which allow users to add information, fill gaps, or revise existing information on a semantic basis, while keeping the knowledge base automatically updated.

17022;"Analysis of web clustering based on genetic algorithm with latent semantic indexing technology";0;"Song, W. and Park, S.C.";"This paper constructed a latent semantic text model using genetic algorithm (GA) for web clustering. The main difficulty in the application of GA for text clustering is thousands or even tens of thousands of dimensions in the feature space. Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a successful technology which attempts to explore the latent semantics structure in textual data, and furthermore, it reduces this large space to smaller one and provides a robust space for clustering. GA belongs to search techniques that efficiently evolve the optimal solution for the problem. Evolved in the reduced latent semantic indexing model, GA can improve clustering accuracy and speed which is typically suitable for real time clustering. We used SSTRESS criteria to analyze the dissimilarity between original term-by-document corpus matrix and the approximate decomposition matrix with different ranks corresponding to the performance of our algorithm evolved in the reduced space. The superiority of GA applied in LSI model over K-means and conventional GA in the vector space model (VSM) is demonstrated by providing good Reuter text clustering results.

Ambiguity may be due to the derivation feature, which is very common in the Arabic language.

17032;"Not all words are created equal: Extracting semantic orientation as a function of adjective relevance";0;"Voll, K.a  and Taboada, M.b ";"Semantic orientation (SO) for texts is often determined on the basis of the positive or negative polarity, or sentiment, found in the text. Polarity is typically extracted using the positive and negative words in the text, with a particular focus on adjectives, since they convey a high degree of opinion. Not all adjectives are created equal, however. Adjectives found in certain parts of the text, and adjectives that refer to particular aspects of what is being evaluated have more significance for the overall sentiment of the text. To capitalize upon this, we weigh adjectives according to their relevance and create three measures of SO: a baseline SO using all adjectives (no restriction); SO using adjectives found in ontopic sentences as determined by a decision-tree classifier; and SO using adjectives in the nuclei of sentences extracted from a high-level discourse parse of the text. In both cases of restricting adjectives based on relevance, performance is comparable to current results in automated SO extraction. Improvements in the decision classifier and discourse parser will likely cause this result to surpass current benchmarks.

17050;"PORE: Positive-only relation extraction from wikipedia text";0;"Wang, G. and Yu, Y. and Zhu, H.";"Extracting semantic relations is of great importance for the creation of the Semantic Web content. It is of great benefit to semi-automatically extract relations from the free text of Wikipedia using the structured content readily available in it.

Multi-class classification methods are not reasonable since no classification of relation types is available in Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose PORE (Positive-Only Relation Extraction), for relation extraction from Wikipedia text. The core algorithm B-POL extends a state-of-the-art positive-only learning algorithm using bootstrapping, strong negative identification, and transductive inference to work with fewer positive training examples. We conducted experiments on several relations with different amount of training data. The experimental results show that B-POL can work effectively given only a small amount of positive training examples and it significantly outperforms the original positive learning approaches and a multi-class SVM. Furthermore, although PORE is applied in the context of Wikipedia, the core algorithm B-POL is a general approach for Ontology Population and can be adapted to other domains.

17053;"Supervised latent semantic indexing using adaptive sprinkling";0;"Chakraborti, S. and Mukras, R. and Lothian, R. and Wiratunga, N. and Watt, S. and Harper, D.";"Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) has been shown to be effective in recovering from synonymy and polysemy in text retrieval applications. However, since LSI ignores class labels of training documents, LSI generated representations are not as effective in classification tasks. To address this limitation, a process called sprinkling is presented. Sprinkling is a simple extension of LSI based on augmenting the set of features using additional terms that encode class knowledge. However, a limitation of sprinkling is that it treats all classes (and classifiers) in the same way. To overcome this, we propose a more principled extension called Adaptive Sprinkling (AS). AS leverages confusion matrices to emphasise the differences between those classes which are hard to separate. The method is tested on diverse classification tasks, including those where classes share ordinal or hierarchical relationships. These experiments reveal that AS can significantly enhance the performance of instance-based techniques (kNN) to make them competitive with the state-of-the-art SVM classifier.

17060;"Bayesian folding-in with Dirichlet kernels for PLSI";0;"Hinneburg, A.a  and Gabriel, H.-H.b  and Gohr, A.c ";"Probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) represents documents of a collection as mixture proportions of latent topics, which are learned from the collection by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. New documents or queries need to be folded into the latent topic space by a simplified version of the EM-algorithm. During PLSI-Folding-in of a new document, the topic mixtures of the known documents are ignored. This may lead to a suboptimal model of the extended collection. Our new approach incorporates the topic mixtures of the known documents in a Bayesian way during foldingin. That knowledge is modeled as prior distribution over the topic simplex using a kernel density estimate of Dirichlet kernels. We demonstrate the advantages of the new Bayesian folding-in using real text data.

17071;"A novel document clustering model based on latent semantic analysis";0;"Song, W. and Soon, C.P.";"In this paper we propose a document representation model based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) for text clustering. Most classic clustering systems represent document with a set of indices, which have been known as vector space model (VSM). In such a model, documents are encoded as vectors in N-dimensional space, where N is the number of unique terms. However, this method causes that the scalability will be poor and the cost of computational time will be high. Latent semantic analysis is a promising approach which attempts to construct a latent semantic structure in textual data and finds relevant documents such that they may not even share any common words, moreover, it reduces the large term-by-document matrix to a smaller one and provides a robust space for clustering. Two clustering algorithms, K-means and genetic algorithm (GA), are constructed in LSA space to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our text representation model. We use SSTRESS criteria to analyze the dissimilarity between the original corpus matrix and the approximate objective matrix with different ranks corresponding to the performance of the two clustering algorithms. The superiority of GA and K-means applied in LSA model over conventional GA and K-means in VSM is demonstrated by providing good text clustering results.

In this research, a systematic study is conducted, in which three different document representation methods for text are used, together with three Dimension Reduction Techniques (DRT), in the context of the text clustering pmblem. Several standard benchmark datasets are used. The three Document representation methods considered are based on the vector space model, and they include word, multi-word term, and character N-gram representations. The dimension reduction methods are independent component analysis (ICA), latent semantic indexing (LSI), and a feature selection technique based on Document Frequency (DF). Results are compared in terms of clustering performance, using the k-means clustering algorithm. Experiments show that ICA and LSI are clearly better than DF on all datasets. For word and N-gram representation, ICA generally gives better results compared with LSI. Experiments also show that the word representation gives better clustering results compared to term and N-gram representation. Finally, for the N-gram representation, it is demonstrated that a profile length (before dimensionality reduction) of 2000 is sufficient to capture the information and, in most cases, a 4-gram representation gives better performance than 3-gram representation.

17094;"Regularized locality preserving indexing via spectral regression";0;"Cai, D. and He, X. and Zhang, W.V. and Han, J.";"We consider the problem of document indexing and representation. Recently, Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) was proposed for learning a compact document subspace. Different from Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) which is optimal in the sense of global Euclidean structure, LPI is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure. However, LPI is not efficient in time and memory which makes it difficult to be applied to very large data set. Specifically, the computation of LPI involves eigen-decompositions of two dense matrices which is expensive. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Regularized Locality Preserving Indexing (RLPI). Benefit from recent progresses on spectral graph analysis, we cast the original LPI algorithm into a regression framework which enable us to avoid eigen-decomposition of dense matrices. Also, with the regression based framework, different kinds of regularizers can be naturally incorporated into our algorithm which makes it more flexible. Extensive experimental results show that RLPI obtains similar or better results comparing to LPI and it is significantly faster, which makes it an efficient and effective data preprocessing method for large scale text clustering, classification and retrieval.

17097;"Extracting unrecognized gene relationships from the biomedical literature via matrix factorizations";0;"Kim, H. and Park, H. and Drake, B.L.";"Background: The construction of literature-based networks of gene-gene interactions is one of the most important applications of text mining in bioinformatics. Extracting potential gene relationships from the biomedical literature may be helpful in building biological hypotheses that can be explored further experimentally. Recently, latent semantic indexing based on the singular value decomposition (LSI/SVD) has been applied to gene retrieval. However, the determination of the number of factors k used in the reduced rank matrix is still an open problem. Results: In this paper, we introduce a way to incorporate a priori knowledge of gene relationships into LSI/SVD to determine the number of factors. We also explore the utility of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract unrecognized gene relationships from the biomedical literature by taking advantage of known gene relationships. A gene retrieval method based on NMF (GR/NMF) showed comparable performance with LSI/SVD. Conclusion: Using known gene relationships of a given gene, we can determine the number of factors used in the reduced rank matrix and retrieve unrecognized genes related with the given gene by LSI/SVD or GR/ NMF.

In order to easily utilize biomedical information in the free text, document clustering and text summarization together are used as a solution for text information overload problem. In this paper, we introduce a coherent graph-based semantic clustering and summarization approach for biomedical literature. Results: Our extensive experimental results show the approach shows 45% cluster quality improvement and 72% clustering reliability improvement, in terms of misclassification index, over Bisecting K-means as a leading document clustering approach. In addition, our approach provides concise but rich text summary in key concepts and sentences. Conclusion: Our coherent biomedical literature clustering and summarization approach that takes advantage of ontology-enriched graphical representations significantly improves the quality of document clusters and understandability of documents through summaries.

17100;"Wordplay: An examination of semantic approaches to classify safety reports";0;"Wolfe, S.R.a  b  c ";"Aviation safety reports, such as those of the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), provide a valuable record of safety incidents for industry analysts. Unfortunately, the sheer quantity of safety reports often makes it difficult to identify recurring safety issues and their causes. In response, NASA has explored the use of text classification techniques to automatically identify safety issues from the text of safety reports. One common approach for text classification is to use a statistical model of word occurrences in each report (often referred to as a bag of words), and use these models to train a classifier. We performed an experiment to evaluate whether simple semantic approaches could improve classification results with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier by factoring semantic relationships of words into the statistical model. Counter to our intuition, most of these semantic enhancements did not improve classification results.

17102;"Exploiting aspectual features and connecting words for summarization-inspired temporal-relation extraction";0;"Dorr, B.J.a  and Gaasterland, T.b ";"This paper presents a model that incorporates contemporary theories of tense and aspect and develops a new framework for extracting temporal relations between two sentence-internal events, given their tense, aspect, and a temporal connecting word relating the two events. A linguistic constraint on event combination has been implemented to detect incorrect parser analyses and potentially apply syntactic reanalysis or semantic reinterpretation - in preparation for subsequent processing for multi-document summarization. An important contribution of this work is the extension of two different existing theoretical frameworks - Hornsteins 1990 theory of tense analysis and Allens 1984 theory on event ordering - and the combination of both into a unified system for representing and constraining combinations of different event types (points, closed intervals, and open-ended intervals). We show that our theoretical results have been verified in a large-scale corpus analysis. The framework is designed to inform a temporally motivated sentence-ordering module in an implemented multi-document summarization system. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

17105;"Text classification based on partial least square analysis";0;"Zeng, X.-Q.a  b  and Wang, M.-W.c  and Nie, J.-Y.d ";"Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a favorite feature extraction method used in text classification. Since when important global features for all the classes can be determined by LSI, important local features for small classes may be ignored, this leads to poor performance on these small classes. To solve this problem, a novel method based on Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis is proposed by integrating class information into the latent classification structure. Important features are extracted according to both their descriptive power of document contents as in LSI, and their capacity of discriminating classes. The extracted features are applied to several classification algorithms: SVM, kNN, C4.5 and SMO. Experiments on Reuters prove that the features extracted by our method outperform those extracted by LSI in all the cases. In particular, the gain obtained by our method is the most apparent on small classes.

However, the increase of email users has resulted in the dramatic increase of spam emails during the past few years. As spammers always try to find a way to evade existing filters, new filters need to be developed to catch spam. Ontologies allow for machine-understandable semantics of data. It is important to share information with each other for more effective spam filtering. Thus, it is necessary to build ontology and a framework for efficient email filtering. Using ontology that is specially designed to filter spam, bunch of unsolicited bulk email could be filtered out on the system. Similar to other filters, the ontology evolves with the user requests. Hence the ontology would be customized for the user. This paper proposes to find an efficient spam email filtering method using adaptive ontology.

In this paper, we show how Semantic Web technologies can deliver a unified representation to explore, query and reason about a multitude of software artifacts. A novel feature is the automatic integration of two important types of software maintenance artifacts, source code and documents, by populating their corresponding sub-ontologies through code analysis and text mining.

17123;"The semantic-document approach to combining documents and ontologies";0;"Eriksson, H.";"An ontology is a powerful way of representing knowledge for multiple purposes. There are several ontology languages for describing concepts, properties, objects, and relationships. However, ontologies in information systems are not primarily written for human reading and communication among humans. For many business, government, and scientific purposes, written documents are the primary description and communication media for human knowledge communication. Unfortunately, there is a significant gap between knowledge expressed as textual documents and knowledge represented as ontologies. Semantic documents aim at combining documents and ontologies, and allowing users to access the knowledge in multiple ways. By adding annotations to electronic-document formats and including ontologies in electronic documents, it is possible to reconcile documents and ontologies, and to provide new services, such as ontology-based searches of large document databases. To accomplish this goal, semantic documents require tools that support both complex ontologies and advanced document formats. The ProtÃ©gÃ© ontology editor, together with a custom-tailored documentation-handling extension, enables developers to create semantic documents by linking preexisting documents to ontologies.

17124;"Psychiatric consultation record retrieval using scenario-based representation and multilevel mixture model";0;"Yu, L.-C.a  and Wu, C.-H.a  and Jang, F.-L.b ";"Psychiatric consultation record retrieval attempts to help people to efficiently and effectively locate the consultation records relevant to their depressive problems. Consultation records can also make people aware that they are not alone, because many individuals have suffered from the same or similar problems. Additionally, people can understand how to alleviate their depressive symptoms according to recommendations from health professionals. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes the use of a scenario-based representation, i.e., a symptom-based structural representation, to capture the depressive symptoms and their semantic relations, such as cause-effect and temporal relations, for understanding users queries clearly. The symptoms and relations are identified from semantic mining and analysis of consultation records. The multilevel mixture model is adopted to estimate the relevance of queries and consultation records based on the structural information. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves higher precision than does a term-based flat representation. An experiment is also conducted to examine the effect of error propagation resulting from incorrect identification of symptoms and relations.

17126;"Semantic labeling of data by using the Web";0;"Rigutini, L. and Di Iorio, E. and Ernandes, M. and Maggini, M.";"This paper proposes a system for automatically categorizing terms or lexical entities into a predefined set of semantic domains. We present an approach that exploits the knowledge available in the Web to create a model of each term or entity (Entity Context Lexicons - ECLs). Each profile is simply a list of terms (similar to the Bag-Of-Words representation in text categorization) and it is composed primarily by the words often appearing in the same contexts of the entity. These profiles model the contexts in which the entity usually appears and they can be subsequently processed by an automatic classifier. Moreover, we propose and validate a profile-based categorization model developed for this particular task which uses the ECLs of the training entities to build a profile for each class (Class-Context lexicon - CCL). Finally, we propose a technique for dealing with multi-label classification based on a decision module that exploits a neural network. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a term categorization task using a standard benchmark composed of a set of domain-specific lexicons (WordNetDomains).

17128;"Recognition of pornographic Web pages by classifying texts and images";0;"Hu, W.a  and Wu, O.a  and Chen, Z.a  and Fu, Z.a  and Maybank, S.b ";"With the rapid development of the World Wide Web, people benefit more and more from the sharing of information. However, Web pages with obscene, harmful, or illegal content can be easily accessed. It is important to recognize such unsuitable, offensive, or pornographic Web pages. In this paper, a novel framework for recognizing pornographic Web pages is described. A C4.5 decision tree is used to divide Web pages, according to content representations, into continuous text pages, discrete text pages, and image pages. These three categories of Web pages are handled, respectively, by a continuous text classifier, a discrete text classifier, and an algorithm that fuses the results from the image classifier and the discrete text classifier. In the continuous text classifier, statistical and semantic features are used to recognize pornographic texts. In the discrete text classifier, the naive Bayes rule is used to calculate the probability that a discrete text is pornographic. In the image classifier, the objects contour-based features are extracted to recognize pornographic images. In the text and image fusion algorithm, the Bayes theory is used to combine the recognition results from images and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the continuous text classifier outperforms the traditional keyword-statistics-based classifier, the contour-based image classifier outperforms the traditional skin-region-based image classifier, the results obtained by our fusion algorithm outperform those by either of the individual classifiers, and our framework can be adapted to different categories of Web pages.

This article develops a new type of lexical feature for use in stylistic text classification, based on taxonomies of various semantic functions of certain choice words or phrases. We demonstrate the usefulness of such features for the stylistic text classification tasks of determining author identity and nationality, the gender of literary characters, a texts sentiment (positive/negative evaluation), and the rhetorical character of scientific journal articles.

The matching of semantic and phonetic information is captured by a unified framework via a bipartite graph model. By considering various technical challenges of the problem, including order insensitivity and partial matching, this approach is less rigid than existing approaches and highly robust. One major component is a phonetic matching model which exploits similarity at the phoneme level. Two learning algorithms for learning the similarity information of basic phonemic matching units based on training examples are investigated. By applying the proposed named entity matching model, a mining system is developed for discovering new named entity translations from daily Web news. The system is able to discover new name translations that cannot be found in the existing bilingual dictionary.

17146;"Out-of-context noun phrase semantic interpretation with cross-linguistic evidence";0;"Girju, R.";"The acquisition of semantic knowledge is paramount for any application that requires a deep understanding of natural language text. Motivated by the problem of building a noun phrase-level semantic parser and adapting it to various applications, such as machine translation and multilingual question answering, in this paper we present a domain-independent model for noun phrase semantic interpretation. We investigate the problem based on cross-linguistic evidence from a set of four Romance languages: Spanish, Italian, French, and Romanian. The focus on Romance languages is well motivated. It is generally the case that English noun phrases translate into constructions of the form ""N P N"" in Romance languages where, as we will show, the P (preposition) varies in ways that correlate with the semantics. Thus, based on a set of 22 semantic interpretation categories (such as PART-WHOLE, AGENT, POSSESSION) we present empirical observations regarding the distribution of these semantic categories in a cross-lingual corpus and their mapping to various syntactic constructions in English and Romance. Furthermore, given a training set of English noun phrases along with their translations in the four Romance languages, our algorithm automatically learns classification rules and applies them to unseen noun phrase instances for semantic interpretation. Experimental results are compared against a state-of-the-art model reported in the literature.

Google news is used as the source of data. We describe a probabilistic framework for associating people with groups. A low-dimensional topic-based representation is first obtained for news stories via probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). This is followed by construction of semantic groups by clustering such representations. Unlike many existing social network analysis approaches, which discover groups based only on binary relations (e.g. co-occurrence of people in a news article), our model clusters people using their topic distribution, which introduces contextual information in the group formation process (e.g. some people belong to several groups depending on the specific subject). The model has been used to study evolution of people with respect to topics over time. We also illustrate the advantages of our approach over a simple co-occurrence-based social network extraction method.

17167;"A multi-level framework for the analysis of sequential data";0;"Mooney, C.H. and De Vries, D. and Roddick, J.F.";"Traditionally text mining has had a strong link with information retrieval and classification and has largely aimed to classify documents according to embedded knowledge. Association rule mining and sequence mining, on the other hand, have had a different goal; one of eliciting relationships within or about the data being mined. Recently there has been research conducted using sequence mining techniques on digital document collections by treating the text as sequential data. In this paper we propose a multi-level framework that is applicable to text analysis and that improves the knowledge discovery process by finding additional or hitherto unknown relationships within the data being mined. We believe that this can lead to the detection or fine tuning of the context of documents under consideration and may lead to a more informed classification of those documents. Moreover, since we use a semantic map at varying stages in the framework, we are able to impose a greater degree of focus and therefore a greater transitivity of semantic relatedness that facilitates the improvement in the knowledge discovery process.

17168;"Using lightweight NLP and semantic modeling to realize the internets potential as a corporate radar";0;"Kass, A. and Cowell-Shah, C.";"Many executives wish that they had a more systematic means of using technology to help them identify external events that represent evidence of potential threats or opportunities. The Business Event Advisor is a prototype corporate radar kit that addresses this need. It can be used to create customized solutions to monitor the external business environment in which a company operates. It exploits Internet-based information sources to help decision-makers systematically detect and interpret simple patterns of external events relevant to their business concerns. To accomplish this, it integrates text mining components and a simple inference mechanism around a semantic model of a companys business environment. Applications built with the system can produce structured descriptions of events that may be relevant to a given company, and can then aggregate those events around its model of the companys business environment and suggest what impact(s) these events might have on that company. We discuss our motivation for creating this prototype, the architecture of the system, the kinds of information it can provide, the kinds of models it requires, and possible directions for future research (including use of pattern matching to auto-generate elements of our systems models).

17171;"Scalable collaborative filtering based on latent semantic indexing";0;"Symeonidis, P. and Nanopoulos, A. and Papadopoulos, A. and Manolopoulos, Y.";"Nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are gaining widespread acceptance in recommender systems and e-commerce applications. User ratings are not expected to be independent, as users follow trends of similar rating behavior. In terms of Text Mining, this is analogous to the formation of higher-level concepts from plain terms. In this paper, we propose a novel CF algorithm which uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to detect rating trends and performs recommendations according to them. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation, with two real data sets, and produce results that indicate its superiority over existing CF algorithms.

We adapt a model for predicting dative alternation from (Bresnan et al. 2005); this model incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features. We evaluate the effect of using different types of feature on this classification task and show that the most predictive features for text differ from those for dialog. Finally, we show that modeling this type of syntactic variation improves the performance of surface realization for both text and dialog.

17174;"Ontology based text indexing and querying for the semantic web";0;"KÃ¶hler, J.a  and Philippi, S.b  and Specht, M.c  and RÃ¼egg, A.d ";"This publication shows how the gap between the HTML based internet and the RDF based vision of the semantic web might be bridged, by linking words in texts to concepts of ontologies. Most current search engines use indexes that are built at the syntactical level and return hits based on simple string comparisons. However, the indexes do not contain synonyms, cannot differentiate between homonyms (mouse as a pointing vs. mouse as an animal) and users receive different search results when they use different conjugation forms of the same word. In this publication, we present a system that uses ontologies and Natural Language Processing techniques to index texts, and thus supports word sense disambiguation and the retrieval of texts that contain equivalent words, by indexing them to concepts of ontologies. For this purpose, we developed fully automated methods for mapping equivalent concepts of imported RDF ontologies (for this prototype WordNet, SUMO and OpenCyc). These methods will thus allow the seamless integration of domain specific ontologies for concept based information retrieval in different domains. To demonstrate the practical workability of this approach, a set of web pages that contain synonyms and homonyms were indexed and can be queried via a search engine like query frontend. However, the ontology based indexing approach can also be used for other data mining applications such text clustering, relation mining and for searching free text fields in biological databases.

By viewing the evolution of topics as a Markov chain, we estimate a Markov transition matrix of topics by leveraging social interactions and topic semantics. Metastable states in a Markov chain are applied to the clustering of topics. Applied to the CiteSeer dataset, a collection of documents in academia, we show the trends of research topics, how research topics are related and which are stable. We also show how certain social actors, authors, impact these topics and propose new ways for evaluating author impact.

We argue that there are significant weaknesses in this approach, including flawed assumptions of monotonicity and locality. Instead we propose a pipelined approach where alignment is followed by a classification step, in which we extract features representing high-level characteristics of the entailment problem, and pass the resulting feature vector to a statistical classifier trained on development data.

The first set of descriptive keyword is extracted using document centroid vectors, while the second set of distinctive keyword is extracted from the SVM classification model dividing documents in the topic from the neighboring documents.

17205;"SenseNet: A knowledge representation model for computational semantics";0;"Chen, P.a  and Ding, W.b  and Ding, C.c ";"Knowledge representation is essential for semantics modeling and intelligent information processing. For decades researchers have proposed many knowledge representation techniques. However, it is a daunting problem how to capture deep semantic information effectively and support the construction of a large-scale knowledge base efficiently. This paper describes a new knowledge representation model, SenseNet, which provides semantic support for commonsense reasoning and natural language processing. SenseNet is formalized with a Hidden Markov Model. An inference algorithm is proposed to simulate human-like text analysis procedure. A new measurement, confidence, is introduced to facilitate the text analysis. We present a detailed case study of applying SenseNet to retrieving compensation information from company proxy filings.

17207;"Enhancing text clustering using concept-based mining model";0;"Shehata, S. and Karray, F. and Kamel, M.";"Most of text mining techniques are based on word and/or phrase analysis of the text. The statistical analysis of a term (word or phrase) frequency captures the importance of the term within a document. However, to achieve a more accurate analysis, the underlying mining technique should indicate terms that capture the semantics of the text from which the importance of a term in a sentence and in the document can be derived. A new concept-based mining model that relies on the analysis of both the sentence and the document, rather than, the traditional analysis of the document dataset only is introduced. The proposed mining model consists of a concept-based analysis of terms and a concept-based similarity measure. The term which contributes to the sentence semantics is analyzed with respect to its importance at the sentence and document levels. The model can efficiently find significant matching terms, either words or phrases, of the documents according to the semantics of the text. The similarity between documents relies on a new concept-based similarity measure which is applied to the matching terms between documents. Experiments using the proposed concept-based term analysis and similarity measure in text clustering are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that the newly developed concept-based mining model enhances the clustering quality of sets of documents substantially.

17212;"Corpus-based and knowledge-based measures of text semantic similarity";0;"Mihalcea, R.a  and Corley, C.a  and Strapparava, C.b ";"This paper presents a method for measuring the semantic similarity of texts, using corpus-based and knowledge-based measures of similarity. Previous work on this problem has focused mainly on either large documents (e.g. text classification, information retrieval) or individual words (e.g. synonymy tests). Given that a large fraction of the information available today, on the Web and elsewhere, consists of short text snippets (e.g. abstracts of scientific documents, imagine captions, product descriptions), in this paper we focus on measuring the semantic similarity of short texts. Through experiments performed on a paraphrase data set, we show that the semantic similarity method out-performs methods based on simple lexical matching, resulting in up to 13% error rate reduction with respect to the traditional vector-based similarity metric.

Further, a new combining method is proposed for the classification, which consists of Grouping, LSA followed by the k-Nearest Neighbor classification (k-NN). The combining method proposed here, shows the higher accuracy in the classification than the conventional methods of the kNN, and the LSA followed by the kNN. Then, the combining method shows almost same accuracies as SVM.

17214;"An improved text categorization methodology based on second and third order probabilistic feature extraction and neural network classifiers";0;"Karras, D.A.";"In this paper we deal with the main aspect of the problem of extracting meaning from documents, namely, with the problem of text categorization, outlining a novel and systematic approach to its solution. We present a text categorization system for non-domain specific full-text documents. The main contribution of this paper lies on the feature extraction methodology which, first, involves word semantic categories and not raw words as other rival approaches. As a consequence of coping with the problem of dimensionality reduction, the proposed approach introduces a novel second and third order feature extraction approach for text categorization by considering word semantic categories cooccurrence analysis. The suggested methodology compares favorably to widely accepted, raw word frequency based techniques in a collection of documents concerning the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system. In these comparisons different Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) algorithms, the LVQ and the conventional k-NN technique are involved.

We construct a combined feature set that consists of both sememes and the Chinese words, propose a CHI-MCOR weighing method according to the weighing theories and classification precision. The effectiveness of the competitive network and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network in text classification are examined. Experimental result shows that if the words are extracted properly, not only the feature dimension is smaller but also the classification precision is higher, the RBF network outperform competitive network for automatic text classification because of the application of supervised learning. Besides its much shorter training time than the BP networks, the RBF network makes precision and recall rates that are almost at the same level as the BP networks.

17228;"A mixture model for contextual text mining";0;"Mei, Q. and Zhai, C.";"Contextual text mining is concerned with extracting topical themes from a text collection with context information (e.g., time and location) and comparing/analyzing the variations of themes over different contexts. Since the topics covered in a document are usually related to the context of the document, analyzing topical themes within context can potentially reveal many interesting theme patterns. In this paper, we propose a new general probabilistic model for contextual text mining that can cover several existing models as special cases. Specifically, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model by introducing context variables to model the context of a document. The proposed mixture model, called contextual probabilistic latent semantic analysis (CPLSA) model, can be applied to many interesting mining tasks, such as temporal text mining, spatiotemporal text mining, author-topic analysis, and cross-collection comparative analysis. Empirical experiments show that the proposed mixture model can discover themes and their contextual variations effectively.

17234;"Mining semantically related terms from biomedical literature";0;"NenadiÄ‡, G.a  b  and Ananiadou, S.a  c ";"Discovering links and relationships is one of the main challenges in biomedical research, as scientists are interested in uncovering entities that have similar functions, take part in the same processes, or are coregulated. This article discusses the extraction of such semantically related entities (represented by domain terms) from biomedical literature. The method combines various text-based aspects, such as lexical, syntactic, and contextual similarities between terms. Lexical similarities are based on the level of sharing of word constituents. Syntactic similarities rely on expressions (such as term enumerations and conjunctions) in which a sequence of terms appears as a single syntactic unit. Finally, contextual similarities are based on automatic discovery of relevant contexts shared among terms. The approach is evaluated using the Genia resources, and the results of experiments are presented. Lexical and syntactic links have shown high precision and low recall, while contextual similarities have resulted in significantly higher recall with moderate precision. By combining the three metrics, we achieved F measures of 68% for semanticalty related terms and 37% for highly related entities.

17237;"Ontologies on demand? A description of the state-of-the-art, applications, challenges and trends for ontology learning from text";0;"Cimiano, P. and VÃ¶lker, J. and Studer, R.";"Ontologies are nowadays used for many applications requiring data, services and resources in general to be interoperable and machine understandable. Such applications are for example web service discovery and composition, information integration across databases, intelligent search, etc. The general idea is that data and services are semantically described with respect to ontologies, which are formal specifications of a domain of interest, and can thus be shared and reused in a way such that the shared meaning specified by the ontology remains formally the same across different parties and applications. As the cost of creating ontologies is relatively high, different proposals have emerged for learning ontologies from structured and unstructured resources. In this article we examine the maturity of techniques for ontology learning from textual resources, addressing the question whether the state-of-the-art is mature enough to produce ontologies on demand.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";15;"2006";"Information-Wissenschaft und Praxis";;"Review";"Trata-se da construção de ontologias.";"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33749657990&partnerID=40&md5=fe010c0f87b54bbee78e19abef483634";"57";"315-320";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"11/08/2014";"1";"N";"Y";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"geracao automatica de ontologia";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"
17243;"Learning question classifiers: The role of semantic information";0;"Li, X. and Roth, D.";"To respond correctly to a free form factual question given a large collection of text data, one needs to understand the question to a level that allows determining some of the constraints the question imposes on a possible answer. These constraints may include a semantic classification of the sought after answer and may even suggest using different strategies when looking for and verifying a candidate answer. This work presents a machine learning approach to question classification. Guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of answer types, we develop a hierarchical classifier that classifies questions into fine-grained classes. This work also performs a systematic study of the use of semantic information sources in natural language classification tasks. It is shown that, in the context of question classification, augmenting the input of the classifier with appropriate semantic category information results in significant improvements to classification accuracy. We show accurate results on a large collection of free-form questions used in TREC 10 and 11.

17245;"Named relationship mining from medical literature";0;"Bichindaritz, I.";"This article addresses the task of mining named relationships between concepts from biomedical literature for indexing purposes or for scientific discovery from medical literature. This research builds on previous work on concept mining from medical literature for indexing purposes and proposes to learn semantic relationships names between concepts learnt. Previous ConceptMiner system did learn pairs of concepts, expressing a relationship between two concepts, but did not learn relationships semantic names. Building on ConceptMiner, RelationshipMiner is interested in learning as well the relationships with their name identified from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge-base as a basis for creating higher-level knowledge structures, such as rules, cases, and models, in future work. Current system is focused on learning semantically typed relationships as predefined in the UMLS, for which a dictionary of synonyms and variations has been created. An evaluation is presented showing that actually this relationship mining task improves the concept mining task results by enabling a better screening of the relationships between concepts for relevant ones.

Our approach relies on term categorization, defined as the task of labeling previously unlabeled terms according to a predefined set of domains. We approach this as a supervised learning problem in which term classifiers are built using the initial lexicons as training data. Dually to classic text categorization tasks in which documents are represented as vectors in a space of terms, we represent terms as vectors in a space of documents. We present the results of a number of experiments in which we use a boosting-based learning device for training our term classifiers. We test the effectiveness of our method by using WordNetDomains, a wellknown large set of domain-specific lexicons, as a benchmark. Our experiments are performed using the documents in the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 as implicit representations for our terms.

In this paper we propose an SVM based approach to hierarchical relation extraction, using features derived automatically from a number of GATE-based open-source language processing tools. In comparison to the previous works, we use several new features including part of speech tag, entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semantic representation of sentence and WordNet synonym set. The impact of the features on the performance is investigated, as is the impact of the relation classification hierarchy. The results show there is a trade-off among these factors for relation extraction and the features containing more information such as semantic ones can improve the performance of the ontological relation extraction task.

First, it introduces the notion of consistent classification which takes into account the semantics of a class hierarchy. Then, it presents a novel global hierarchical approach that produces consistent classification. This algorithm with AdaBoost as the underlying learning procedure significantly outperforms the corresponding ""fiat"" approach, i.e. the approach that does not take into account the hierarchical information. In addition, the proposed algorithm surpasses the hierarchical local top-down approach on many synthetic and real tasks. For evaluation purposes, we use a novel hierarchical evaluation measure that has some attractive properties: it is simple, requires no parameter tuning, gives credit to partially correct classification and discriminates errors by both distance and depth in a class hierarchy.

17253;"Evaluating WordNet features in text classification models";0;"Mansuy, T. and Hilderman, R.J.";"Incorporating semantic features from the WordNet lexical database is among one of the many approaches that have been tried to improve the predictive performance of text classification models. The intuition behind this is that keywords in the training set alone may not be extensive enough to enable generation of u universal model for a category, but if we incorporate the word relationships in WordNet, a more accurate model may be possible. Other researchers have previously evaluated the effectiveness of incorporating WordNet synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms into text classification models. Generally, they have found that improvements in accuracy using features derived from these relationships are dependent upon the nature of the text corpora from which the document collections are extracted. In this paper, we not only reconsider the role of WordNet synonyms, hypernyms. and hyponyms in text classification models, we also consider the role of WordNet meronyms and holonyms. Incorporating these WordNet relationships into a Coordinate Matching classifier, a Naive Bayes classifier, and a Support Vector Machine classifier, we evaluate our approach on six document collections extracted from the Reuters-21578, USENET, and Digi-Trad text corpora. Experimental results show that none of the WordNet relationships were effective ut increasing the accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier. Synonyms, hypernyms, and holonyms were effective at increasing the accuracy of the Coordinate Matching classifier, and hypernyms were effective at increasing the accuracy of the SVM classifier.

Text classifiers based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) try to make the most of the independent components of text documents and give in many cases good classification effects.

Our aim is to solve the shorttext problem in text classification by using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as a data preprocessing method, then employing ICA for the preprocessed data. The experiment shows that using ICA and LSA together rather than only using ICA in Chinese short-text classification can provide better classification effects.

17265;"Multi-document summarization based on BE-vector clustering";0;"Liu, D.a  b  c  and He, Y.a  c  and Ji, D.c  d  and Yang, H.a  c ";"In this paper, we propose a novel multi-document summarization strategy based on Basic Element (BE) vector clustering. In this strategy, sentences are represented by BE vectors instead of word or term vectors before clustering. BE is a head-modifier-relation triple representation of sentence content, and it is more precise to use BE as semantic unit than to use word. The BE-vector clustering is realized by adopting the k-means clustering method, and a novel clustering analysis method is employed to automatically detect the number of clusters, K.

17266;"Disambiguation based on wordnet for transliteration of Arabic Numerals for Korean TTS";0;"Jung, Y.a  and Yoon, A.b  and Kwon, H.-C.a ";"Transliteration of Arabic numerals is not easily resolved. Arabic numerals occur frequently in scientific and informative texts and deliver significant meanings. Since readings of Arabic numerals depend largely on their context, generating accurate pronunciation of Arabic numerals is one of the critical criteria in evaluating TTS systems. In this paper, (1) contextual, pattern, and arithmetic features are extracted from a transliterated corpus; (2) ambiguities of homographie classifiers are resolved based on the semantic relations in KorLex1.0 (Korean Lexico-Semantic Network); (3) a classification model for accurate and efficient transliteration of Arabic numerals is proposed in order to improve Korean TTS systems. The proposed model yields 97.3% accuracy, which is 9.5% higher than that of a customized Korean TTS system.

17267;"A semantic approach for mining hidden links from complementary and non-interactive biomedical literature";0;"Hu, X.a  and Zhang, X.a  and Yoo, I.a  and Zhang, Y.b ";"Two complementary and non-interactive literature sets of articles, when they are considered together, can reveal useful information of scientific interest not apparent in either of the two sets alone. Swanson called the existence of such hidden links as undiscovered public knowledge (UPK). The novel connection between Raynaud disease and fish oils was uncovered from complementary and non-interactive biomedical literature by Swanson in 1986. Since then, there have been many approaches to uncover UPK by mining the biomedical literature. These earlier works, however, required substantial manual intervention to reduce the number of possible connections. This paper proposes a semantic-based mining model for undiscovered public knowledge using the biomedical literature. Our method replaces manual ad-hoc pruning by using semantic knowledge from the biomedical ontologies. Using the semantic types and semantic relationships of the biomedical concepts, our prototype system can identify the relevant concepts collected from Medline and generate the novel hypothesis between these concepts. The system successfully replicates Swansons two famous discoveries: Raynaud disease/fish oils and migraine/magnesium. Compared with previous approaches such as LSI-based and traditional association rule-based methods, our method generates much fewer but more relevant novel hypotheses, and requires much less human intervention in the discovery procedure.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";13;"2006";"Proceedings of the Sixth SIAM International Conference on Data Mining";;"Conference Paper";"17557 foi considerado duplicado deste.";"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33745438114&partnerID=40&md5=0c2d738fc3a16d123ebace7f098c178d";"2006";"200-209";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"04/08/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"relacoes semanticas";"null";"null";"ontologias biomedicas";"null";"relation extraction";"null";"null";"null";"Medline";"biomedicina";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

The controlled vocabularies attempt to reduce ambiguity by defining the scope of terms and more complex vocabularies provide a set of effective synonyms for each concept.

This research takes place within the Telemakus project, which has for goal to support and facilitate the knowledge discovery process by providing retrieval, visual, and interaction tools to mine and map research findings from research literature in the field of aging. A concept mining component automating research findings extraction such as the one presented here, would permit Telemakus to be efficiently applied to other domains. The main strategy that has been followed in this project has been to mine from the legends of the documents the research findings as relationships between concepts from the medical literature. The concept mining proceeds through stages of syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, relationships building, and ranking. Evaluation results are presented at the end and show that the system learns concepts and relationships between them with good recall, and that these concepts can be used for indexing the documents.

17275;"Exploring supervised and unsupervised methods to detect topics in biomedical text";0;"Lee, M.a  and Wang, W.b  and Yu, H.a ";"Background: Topic detection is a task that automatically identifies topics (e.g., ""biochemistry"" and ""protein structure"") in scientific articles based on information content. Topic detection will benefit many other natural language processing tasks including information retrieval, text summarization and question answering; and is a necessary step towards the building of an information system that provides an efficient way for biologists to seek information from an ocean of literature. Results: We have explored the methods of Topic Spotting, a task of text categorization that applies the supervised machine-learning technique naÃ¯ve Bayes to assign automatically a document into one or more predefined topics; and Topic Clustering, which apply unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithms to aggregate documents into clusters such that each cluster represents a topic. We have applied our methods to detect topics of more than fifteen thousand of articles that represent over sixteen thousand entries in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. We have explored bag of words as the features. Additionally, we have explored semantic features; namely, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) that are assigned to the MEDLINE records, and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic types that correspond to the MeSH terms, in addition to bag of words, to facilitate the tasks of topic detection. Our results indicate that incorporating the MeSH terms and the UMLS semantic types as additional features enhances the performance of topic detection and the naÃ¯ve Bayes has the highest accuracy, 66.4%, for predicting the topic of an OMIM article as one of the total twenty-five topics. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the supervised topic spotting methods outperformed the unsupervised topic clustering; on the other hand, the unsupervised topic clustering methods have the advantages of being robust and applicable in real world settings.

17276;"Document clustering using nonnegative matrix factorization";0;"Shahnaz, F.a  and Berry, M.W.a  and Pauca, V.P.b  and Plemmons, R.J.b ";"A methodology for automatically identifying and clustering semantic features or topics in a heterogeneous text collection is presented. Textual data is encoded using a low rank nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to retain natural data nonnegativity, thereby eliminating the need to use subtractive basis vector and encoding calculations present in other techniques such as principal component analysis for semantic feature abstraction. Existing techniques for nonnegative matrix factorization are reviewed and a new hybrid technique for nonnegative matrix factorization is proposed. Performance evaluations of the proposed method are conducted on a few benchmark text collections used in standard topic detection studies. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

17279;"Semantic enrichment in knowledge repositories: Annotating semantic relationships between discussion documents";0;"Wei, C.-P.a  d  e  and Cheng, T.-H.b  e e   and Pai, Y.-C.c ";"Among various knowledge management initiatives, the creation of knowledge repositories has emerged as a prevalent approach in current knowledge management practices. In order to transfer tacit knowledge from individuals to a knowledge repository, organizations usually deploy community-based discussion forums. Typically, discussions among participants are organized into reply-replied structures, and reply semantic relationships among these discussion documents exist either explicitly or implicitly. Such relationships, once discovered or annotated in the knowledge repository, can facilitate subsequent knowledge navigation by providing a novel and more semantic mechanism and can support other organizational knowledge management activities (e.g., construction of expert networks). In this study, we propose a preliminary taxonomy of reply semantic relationships for discussion documents organized in reply-replied structures and develop a Semantic Enrichment between Knowledge-sharing documents (SEEK) technique that automatically annotates semantic relationships between reply pairs of documents. Specifically, we propose and evaluate six different feature models that combine keyword features, part-of-speech statistic features, and/or text statistic features.

17280;"Unraveling the taste fabric of social networks";0;"Liu, H. and Maes, P. and Davenport, G.";"Popular online social networks such as Friendster and MySpace do more than simply reveal the superficial structure of social connectedness - the rich meanings bottled within social network profiles themselves imply deeper patterns of culture and taste. If these latent semantic fabrics of taste could be harvested formally, the resultant resource would afford completely novel ways for representing and reasoning about web users and people in general. This paper narrates the theory and technique of such a feat - the natural language text of 100,000 social network profiles were captured, mapped into a diverse ontology of music, books, films, foods, etc., and machine learning was applied to infer a semantic fabric of taste. Taste fabrics bring us closer to improvisational manipulations of meaning, and afford us at least three semantic functions - the creation of semantically flexible user representations, cross-domain taste-based recommendation, and the computation of taste-similarity between people - whose use cases are demonstrated within the context of three applications - the Interest Map, Ambient Semantics, and IdentityMirror. Finally, we evaluate the quality of the taste fabrics, and distill from this research reusable methodologies and techniques of consequence to the semantic mining and Semantic Web communities.

17282;"Semantic trees for natural language representation";0;"Schwind, C.B.";"This paper presents a formalism for the representation of complex semantic relations among concepts of natural language. We define a semantic algebra as a set of atomic concepts together with an ordered set of semantic relations. Semantic trees are a graphical representation of a semantic algebra (comparable to Kantorovic trees for boolean or arithmetical expressions). A semantic tree is an ordered tree with nodes labeled with relation and concept names. We generate semantic trees from natural language texts in such a way that they represent the semantic relations which hold among the concepts occurring within that text. This generation process is carried out by a transformational grammar which transforms directly natural language sentences into semantic trees. We present an example for concepts and relations within the domain of computer science where we have generated semantic trees from definition texts by means of a metalanguage for transformational grammars (a sort of metacompiler for transformational grammars). The semantic trees generated so far serve for thesaurus entries in an information retrieval system.

As an intermediate stage between the German text and the database we use the Discourse Representation Structures (DRS) invented by Hans Kamp. Karnps system has been chosen because it handles intrasentential and intersentential relations uniformly. Within Kamps system one can account for certain types of anaphoric relations for which no other linguistic theory has provided a solution. The input to our system is analysed by a parser which is based on lexical functional grammar. This is the first attempt to combine research on discourse representation with lexical functional grammar with the help of the formalism of Definite Clause Grammar. For the construction of the database out of the DRSs, two solutions are proposed. First, a translation of the DRSs into a set of PROLOG clauses enriched with some additional deductive principles. Second, the formulation of inference rules which operate directly on the DRS.

17287;"A text knowledge base from the AI handbook";0;"Simmons, R.F.";"This research aims at defining a consistent set of text representation conventions for organizing fifty pages of the AI handbook as an inferential knowledge base founded on a procedural logic system of general inference schemes for answering questions from it. As a result of research on the AI handbook project, we have developed a prototype, natural-language, text-knowledge system that includes a data base manager to compile the text knowledge and to make it available to navigational commands. The text is represented as logical propositions that form a set of text axioms to model its content. English questions and commands are translated to corresponding logical formulas and treated as theorems to be proved with respect to the text model. The logical form is that of semantic relations (SRs)-logical predicates with varying numbers and ordering of arguments. To compute effectively with such a free form, a relaxed unification procedure was defined as the basis of the SR theorem prover.

17292;"Frame-based representation of philosophical systems using a knowledge engineering tool";0;"Longeart, M.a  and Boss, G.b  and Skuce, D.c ";"This article addresses the methodological problem of the non-linear representation of philosophical systems in a computerized knowledge base. It is a problem of knowledge representation as defined in the field of artificial intelligence. Instead of a purely theoretical discussion of the issue, we present selected results of a practical experiment which has in itself some theoretical significance. We show how one can represent different philosophies using CODE, a knowledge engineering system developed by artificial intelligence researchers. The hypothesis is that such a computer based representation of philosophical systems can give insight into their conceptual structure. We argue that computer aided text analysis can apply knowledge representation tools and techniques developed in artificial intelligence and we estimate how philosophers as well as knowledge engineers could gain from this cross-fertilization. This paper should be considered as an experiment report on the use of knowledge representation techniques in computer aided text analysis. It is part of a much broader project on the representation of conceptual structures in an expert system. However, we intentionally avoided technical issues related to either Computer Science or History of Philosophy to focus on the benefit to enhance traditional humanistic studies with tools and methods developed in AI on the one hand and the need to develop more appropriate tools on the other.

The module evaluates a large incoming stream of documents to determine which documents are sufficiently similar to a profile at the broad subject level to warrant more refined representation and matching. To accomplish this task, each substantive word in a text is first categorized using a feature set based on the semantic Subject Field Codes (SFCs) assigned to individual word senses in a machine-readable dictionary. When tested on 50 user profiles and 550 megabytes of documents, results indicate that the feature set that is the basis of the text categorization module and the algorithm that establishes the boundary of categories of potentially relevant documents accomplish their tasks with a high level of performance. This means that the category of potentially relevant documents for most profiles would contain at least 80% of all documents later determined to be relevant to the profile.

17315;"Integrating linguistic primitives in learning context-dependent representation";0;"Chan, S.W.K.a  b ";"This paper presents an explicit connectionist-inspired, language learning model in which the process of settling on a particular interpretation for a sentence emerges from the interaction of a set of ""soft"" lexical, semantic, and syntactic primitives. We address how these distinct linguistic primitives can be encoded from different modular knowledge sources but strongly involved in an interactive processing in such a way as to make implicit linguistic information explicit. The learning of a quasi-logical form, called context-dependent representation, is inherently incremental and dynamical in such a way that every semantic interpretation will be related to what has already been presented in the context created by prior utterances. With the aid of the context-dependent representation, the capability of the language learning model in text understanding is strengthened. This approach also shows how the recursive and compositional role of a sentence as conveyed in the syntactic structure can be modeled in a neurobiologically motivated linguistics based on dynamical systems rather on combinatorial symbolic architecture.

For single FA terms, five levels of association are defined and two ranks are defined, based on stability and inheritance. About 85% of redundant compound FA terms can be removed effectively by using levels and ranks proposed in this paper. Recall averages of 60-80% are achieved, depending on the type of text.

The system,called IRAS, described in the paper, is a follow up of a previous theoretical framework,called TOM, presented at MIS 2002, Bellacicco [1]. The innovation of IRAS is the exploitation of parsing algorithms for the identification of the semantic organization of the statements so that the answer is specific for the real content of the question. Problem faced by IRAS is therefore to overcome besides the stream of thousands pages from the web, the stream of unspecific answers too, which are the fallout of the ambiguity related the use of the terms of the query without the specification of their role in the statement.

We investigate text features relating verbs with genes and proteins, and apply statistical tests and a logistic regression statistical model to determine whether a given verb belongs to the class of interaction verbs. Our system, AVAD, achieves over 87% precision and 82% recall when tested on an 11 million word corpus of journal articles. In addition, we compare the automatically obtained results with a manually constructed database of interaction verbs and show that the automatic approach can significantly enrich the manual list by detecting rarer interaction verbs that were omitted from the database.

However, term mismatches between index terms and query terms have been a serious obstacle to the enhancement of retrieval performance. In this article, we discuss automatic term normalization between words and phrases in text corpora and their application to a Korean information retrieval system. We perform three new types of term normalizations: transliterated word normalization, noun phrase normalization, and context-based term normalization. Transliterated words are normalized into equivalence classes by using contextual similarity to alleviate lexical term mismatches. Then, noun phrases are normalized into phrasal terms by segmenting compound nouns as well as normalizing noun phrases. Moreover, context-based terms are normalized by using a combination of mutual information and word context to establish word similarities. Next, unsupervised clustering is done by using the K-means algorithm and cooccurrence clusters are identified to alleviate semantic term mismatches. These term normalizations are used in both the indexing and the retrieval system. The experimental results show that our proposed system can alleviate three types of term mismatches and can also provide the appropriate similarity measurements.

In case of large and complex application domains this task can be lengthy, costly, and controversial (since different persons may have different points of view about the same concept). To reduce time, cost (and, sometimes, harsh discussions) it is highly advisable to refer, in constructing or updating an ontology, to the documents available in the field. Text mining tools may be of great help in this task.

NeuroText uses a two-step approach to identify relevant articles. The first step (pre-processing), aimed at 100% sensitivity, identifies abstracts containing database keywords. In the second step, potentially relevant abstracts identified in the first step are processed for specificity dictated by database architecture, and neuroscience, lexical and semantic contexts. NeuroText results were presented to the experts for validation using a dynamically generated interface that also allows expert-validated articles to be automatically deposited into the databases. Of the test set of 912 articles, 735 were rejected at the pre-processing step. For the remaining articles, the accuracy of predicting database-relevant articles was 85%. Twenty-two articles were erroneously identified. NeuroText deferred decisions on 29 articles to the expert. A comparison of NeuroText results versus the experts analyses revealed that the program failed to correctly identify articles relevance due to concepts that did not yet exist in the knowledgebase or due to vaguely presented information in the abstracts.

17376;"Measuring praise and criticism: Inference of semantic orientation from association";0;"Turney, P.D.a  c  and Littman, M.L.b  d ";"The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation. Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., ""honest"", ""intrepid"") and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., ""disturbing"", ""superfluous""). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This article introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words).

In this paper, we first explore the possibilities for KDT to enhance communication in virtual communities, and then we present a practical case study with real-life Internet data. The problem in the case study is to manage the very successful virtual communities known as clubs of the largest Dutch Internet Service Provider. It is possible for anyone to start a club about any subject, resulting in over 10,000 active clubs today. At the beginning, the founder assigns the club to a predefined category. This often results in illogical or inconsistent placements, which means that interesting clubs may be hard to locate for potential new members. The ISP therefore is looking for an automated way to categorize clubs in a logical and consistent manner. The method used is the so-called bag-of-words approach, previously applied mostly to scientific texts and structured documents. Each club is described by a vector of word occurrences of all communications within that club. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is applied to reduce the dimensionality problem prior to clustering. Clustering is done by the Within Groups Clustering method using a cosine distance measure appropriate for texts.

This study proposes a concept-based QA system with the understanding abilities, which combines several techniques such as FAQ corpus, text mining, concept space, and so on. The QA system can process the question statement in Chinese natural language fashion and find out the implicit intention of the user query. The question is split into four different terms, namely Subject term, Attribute term, Intention term and Interrogative term. These separate terms then are matched with the existing items in the FAQ corpus to get the proper or similar answers.

However, most guidelines are in free text, not machine comprehensible, and are not easily accessible to clinicians at the point of care. We introduce a Web-based, modular, distributed architecture, the Digital Electronic Guideline Library (DeGeL), which facilitates gradual conversion of clinical guidelines from text to a formal representation in a chosen guideline ontology. The architecture supports guideline classification, semantic markup, context-sensitive search, browsing, run-time application, and retrospective quality assessment. The DeGeL hybrid meta-ontology includes elements common to all guideline ontologies, such as semantic classification, and domain knowledge. The hybrid meta-ontology also includes three guideline-content representation formats: free text, semi-structured text; and a formal representation.

Building a model structure from text with minimum intervention from domain experts and minimum training examples has always been a challenge for the researchers. In the biomedical domain, numerous advances have been made which may make this dream a possibility now. We are currently trying to build a general purpose system to automatically extract the model structure from scientific articles using a combination of ontological knowledge and data mining with natural language processing. This paper discusses the prototype system that we are working on. Previously, systems have used keyword features to extract knowledge from text. We, like Blake et al [4], argue that the choice of features used to represent a domain has a profound effect on the quality of model produced. Our system uses concepts and semantic types rather than keywords. We map complete sentences in the medical text to a conceptual level and a semantic level.

17456;"On the effectiveness of latent semantic analysis for the categorization of call centre records";0;"Menon, R.a  and Keerthi, S.S.b  and Loh, H.T.a  b  c  and Brombacher, A.C.a  d ";"Text categorization is an important component in many information management tasks such as real-time sorting of emails or files. An important consideration in text categorization performance is the choice of feature sets for text representation. A popular approach for text representation is the vector space model. It represents the units of content of a document as a vector. In most situations, each distinct word is used as a content unit. However, such a representation, called the bag-of-word approach has drawbacks. Firstly, a large number of features are required for document representation. Secondly, it does not take into account the effects of synonymy and polysemy, which could have an impact on classification accuracy. Latent semantic analysis addresses the above shortcomings by simultaneously modelling all the interrelationships among terms and documents, using the singular value decomposition technique which allows the representation of the terms and documents in a reduced dimensional space. It has been widely used to enhance the performance of information retrieval systems and recently used for text classification purposes as well. In this study, we further explore its use, for the classification of call centre data sets obtained from a Multi-National Company. These spontaneously created documents exhibit characteristics different from benchmark data sets used in most studies, hence necessitating this investigation. Further, the effect on classification, of various weighting schemes as well as the number of dimensions was explored. Results revealed that the LSA approach marginally improved the classification accuracy. It was also found that the weighting scheme used did not significantly affect classification performance unlike in some retrieval applications where as much as a 40% average improvement in performance was observed. Further, the widely recommended use of 100 to 300 dimensions for document representation was found to be inapplicable for the investigated data sets.

17459;"Coupling grammar and knowledge base: Range Concatenation Grammars and description logics";0;"Sagot, B.a  b  and El Ghali, A.a ";"In this paper we introduce a novel framework to compute jointly syntactic parses and semantic representations of a written sentence. To achieve this goal, we couple a syntactico-semantic grammar and a knowledge base. The knowledge base is implemented in Description Logics, in a polynomial variant. The grammar is a Range Concatenation Grammar, which combines expressive power and polynomial parsing time, and allows external predicate calls.

We exploit domain specific texts and glossaries or dictionaries in order to automatically generate g-groups and f-groups. These groups are sets of concepts/terms which have either taxonomic or non-taxonomic relationships among them. The domain expert ontology engineer reviews these generated groups and uses them to evaluate and enrich the domain ontology.

This paper presents a special summarization method to generate single-document summary with maximum topic completeness and minimum redundancy. It initially implements the semantic-class-based vector representations of various kinds of linguistic units in a document by means of HowNet (an existing ontology), which can improve the representation quality of traditional term-based vector space model in a certain degree. Then, by adopting K-means clustering algorithm as well as a novel clustering analysis algorithm, we can capture the number of different latent topic regions in a document adoptively. Finally, topic representative sentences are selected from each topic region to form the final summary. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed summarization method, a novel metric which is known as representation entropy is used for summarization redundancy evaluation.

Although this approach has several benefits over standard retrieval approaches, methods for automatically acquiring these taxonomies from text documents do not exist, which limits its widespread implementation. To accelerate and simplify feature acquisition and case indexing, we introduce FACIT, a domain independent framework that combines deep natural language processing techniques and generative lexicons to semi-automatically acquire case indexing taxonomies from text documents. FACIT employs a novel method to generate a logical form representation of text, and uses it to automatically extract and organize features. In contrast to standard information extraction approaches, FACITs knowledge extraction approach should be more accurate and robust to syntactic variations in text sources due to its use of logical forms.

We report the performance of LSI on data sets both with and without the inclusion of the test examples, and we show that tailoring the SVD process to the test examples can be even more useful than adding additional training data.

The semantic representation is built up incrementally - in left-to-right order - while the user of the PENG system writes the text. For each word form that the user types, the language processor creates a partial logical structure that is analysed in the context of a given information state and then either updates that information state or delays this process if necessary. After each processing step, the language processor reports what kind of syntactic categories can follow the current input. These predictive grammatical hints guide the writing process of the user and enforce the rules of the controlled language. The result is an unambiguous text in controlled natural language that has first-order equivalent properties and that can be further processed by a computer.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"VERY_LOW";26;"2004";"International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications - DEXA";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-10044266807&partnerID=40&md5=57f43935e95ef73e18cbc713062c7d3a";"15";"43-47";;;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"05/08/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"representacao semantica";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Descreve o uso de uma linguagem natural controlada.";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

17487;"Bio-medical entity extraction using support vector machines";0;"Takeuchi, K.a  and Collier, N.b ";"Objective: Support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several classification tasks. In this article we apply them to the identification and semantic annotation of scientific and technical terminology in the domain of molecular biology. This illustrates the extensibility of the traditional named entity task to special domains with large-scale terminologies such as those in medicine and related disciplines. Methods and materials: The foundation for the model is a sample of text annotated by a domain expert according to an ontology of concepts, properties and relations. The model then learns to annotate unseen terms in new texts and contexts. The results can be used for a variety of intelligent language processing applications. We illustrate SVMs capabilities using a sample of 100 journal abstracts texts taken from the {human, blood cell, transcription factor} domain of MEDLINE. Results: Approximately 3400 terms are annotated and the model performs at about 74% F-score on cross-validation tests. A detailed analysis based on empirical evidence shows the contribution of various feature sets to performance. Conclusion: Our experiments indicate a relationship between feature window size and the amount of training data and that a combination of surface words, orthographic features and head noun features achieve the best performance among the feature sets tested.

Ontologies, as conceptual models, provide the necessary framework for semantic representation of textual information. The principal link between text and an ontology is terminology, which maps terms to domain-specific concepts.

17509;"A neural network model for hierarchical multilingual text categorization";0;"Chau, R. and Yeh, C. and Smith, K.A.";"Enabling navigation via a hierarchy of conceptually related multilingual documents constitutes the fundamental support to global knowledge discovery. This requirement of organizing multilingual document by concepts makes the goal of supporting global knowledge discovery a concept-based multilingual text categorization task. In this paper, intelligent methods for enabling concept-based hierarchical multilingual text categorization using neural networks are proposed. First, a universal concept space, encapsulating the semantic knowledge of the relationship between all multilingual terms and concepts, which is required by concept-based multilingual text categorization, is generated using a self-organizing map. Second, a set of concept-based multilingual document categories, which acts as the hierarchical backbone of a browseable multilingual document directory, are generated using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Third, a concept-based multilingual text classifier is developed using a 3-layer feed-forward neural network to facilitate the concept-based multilingual text categorization.

17511;"RELFIN - Topic discovery for ontology enhancement and annotation";0;"Schaal, M. and MÃ¼ller, R.M. and Brunzel, M. and Spiliopoulou, M.";"While classic information retrieval methods return whole documents as a result of a query, many information demands would be better satisfied by fine-grain access inside the documents. One way to support this goal is to make the semantics of small document regions explicit, e.g. as XML labels, so that query engines can exploit them. To this purpose, the topics of the small document regions must be discovered from the texts; differently from document labelling applications, fine-grain topics cannot be listed in advance for arbitrary collections. Text-understanding approaches can derive the topic of a document region but are less appropriate for the construction of a small set of topics that can be used in queries. To address this challenge we propose the coupling of text mining, prior knowledge explicated in ontologies and human expertise and present the system RELFIN, which is designed to assis the human expert in the discovery of topics appropriate for (i) ontology enhancement with additional concepts or relationships, (ii) semantic characterization and tagging of document regions. RELFIN performs data mining upon linguistically preprocessed corpora to group document regions on topics and constructing the topic labels for them, so that the labels are characteristic of the regions and thus helpful in ontology-based search. We show our first results of applying RELFIN on a case study of text analysis and retrieval.

One of the limitations with the query expansion techniques is that a query is often expanded only by the linguistic features of terms. This paper presents a novel semantic query expansion technique that combines association rules with ontologies and information retrieval techniques. We propose to use the association rule discovery to find good candidate terms to improve the retrieval performance. These candidate terms are automatically derived from collections and added to the original query. Our method is differentiated from others in that 1) it utilizes the semantics as well as linguistic properties of unstructured text corpus and 2) it makes use of contextual properties of important terms discovered by association rules. Experiments conducted on a subset of TREC collections give quite encouraging results. We achieve from 15.49% to 20.98% improvement in term of P@20 with TREC5 ad hoc queries.

17515;"2-PS based associative text classification";0;"Qian, T. and Wang, Y. and Long, H. and Feng, J.";"Recent studies reveal that associative classification can achieve higher accuracy than traditional approaches. The main drawback of this approach is that it generates a huge number of rules, which makes it difficult to select a subset of rules for accurate classification. In this study, we propose a novel association-based approach especially suitable for text classification. The approach first builds a classifier through a 2-PS (Two-Phase) method. The first phase aims for pruning rules locally, i.e., rules mined within every category are pruned by a sentence-level constraint, and this makes the rules more semantically correlated and less redundant. In the second phase, all the remaining rules are compared and selected with a global view, i.e., training examples from different categories are merged together to evaluate these rules. Moreover, when labeling a new document, the multiple sentence-level appearances of a rule are taken into account. Experimental results on the well-known text corpora show that our method can achieve higher accuracy than many well-known methods. In addition, the performance study shows that our method is quite efficient in comparison with other classification methods.

Emerging research in ontology languages (e.g. RDF, RDFS, SUO-KIF, and OWL) offers promising avenues for overcoming these limitations by leveraging existing and future libraries of meta-data and semantic mark-up. Using semantic features (e.g. hypernyms, meronyms, synonyms, etc.) encoded in ontology languages, methods such as keyword search and clustering can be augmented to analyze and visualize documents at conceptually richer levels. We present findings from a hierarchical clustering system modified for ontological indexing and run on a topic-centric test collection of documents each with fewer than 200 words.

To obtain prior positive inputs, KIP first populates its glossary database using manually identified keyphrases and keywords.

17528;"Automatic metadata generation for Web pages using a text mining approach";0;"Yang, H.-C.a  and Lee, C.-H.b ";"The Semantic Web has emerged to replace the World Wide Web (WWW or the Web) as the unique platform for information sharing. Applications such as e-commerce will be and could be plausible only if we can annotate the Web pages with their semantics. For newly developed Semantic Web resources, such annotation can be done manually or by help of some authoring tools. However, it is not practical to semantically annotating existing Web pages due to the gigantic amount of them. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a machine learning approach to automatically generate semantic metadata for Web pages. The proposed automated process adopts the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster training Web pages and conducts a text mining process to discover some semantic descriptions about the Web pages. Preliminary experiments show that our method may generate semantically relevant metadata for the Web pages.

In this paper we address this problem by proposing a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approach based on the intuition that word proximity in the document implies proximity also in the HT graph. We argue that the high precision exhibited by our WSD algorithm in various humanly-disambiguated benchmark datasets, is appropriate for the classification task. Moreover, we define a semantic kernel, based on the general concept of GVSM kernels, that captures the semantic relations contained in the hierarchical thesaurus.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying multi-label classification techniques in the context of temporal expression normalization. More specifically, two models, named independent binary classification model and compared binary classification model, are evaluated, compared and analyzed. Once the possible class(es) of a temporal expression is determined, the corresponding mapping rules are called to transform it into the corresponding attribute(s).

The traditional cosine similarity suffers from its inability to represent the semantic relationship of terms. This paper explores the kernel-based similarity measure by using term clustering. An affinity matrix of terms is constructed via the co-occurrence of the terms in both unsupervised and supervised ways. Normalized cut is employed to do the clustering to cut off the noisy edges. Diffusion kernel is adopted to measure the kernel-like similarity of the terms in the same cluster.

Most existing methods, however, suffer from two main drawbacks; they cannot provide an understandable representation for text clusters, and cannot scale to very large text collections. Highly scalable text clustering algorithms are becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, we present a performance study of a new subspace clustering algorithm for large sparse text data. This algorithm automatically calculates the feature weights in the k-means clustering process. The feature weights are used to discover clusters from subspaces of the text vector space and identify terms that represent the semantics of the clusters. A series of experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the algorithm, including resource consumption and clustering quality. The experimental results on real-world text data have shown that our algorithm quickly converges to a local optimal solution and is scalable to the number of documents, terms and the number of clusters.

We present a new method for sentiment classification based on extracting and analyzing appraisal groups such as ""very good"" or ""not terribly funny"". An appraisal group is represented as a set of attribute values in several task-independent semantic taxonomies, based on Appraisal Theory. Semi-automated methods were used to build a lexicon of appraising adjectives and their modifiers. We classify movie reviews using features based upon these taxonomies combined with standard ""bag-of-words"" features, and report state-of-the-art accuracy of 90.2%.

17552;"Mediating between heterogeneous ontologies using schema matching techniques";0;"Lyttleton, O.a  and Sinclair, D.a  and Tracey, D.b ";"The semantic web envisions an Internet where data can be used by applications just as easily as it can be by humans. Ontologies are a key building block of the semantic web, and can enable applications to have a shared understanding of data, and to be semantically interoperable. However, ontologies from heterogeneous sources may use different terms to represent the same concept. This can present problems for applications which are required to work interoperably with independently produced ontologies. Manually determining semantically equivalent terms between ontologies is a laborious and error-prone process. In this paper, we present an architecture which uses machine-learning techniques to produce mappings between semantically equivalent terms in heterogeneous ontologies. The architecture combines the results of several machine-learning algorithms, in order to be effective with a wider range of data than if a single algorithm were used.

We define Key semantics as characteristic sub-structures of syntactic dependencies in the given documents, and consider the following three tasks in this paper: 1) Key semantics extraction: extracting characteristic syntactic dependency structures not only as ordered trees but also as unordered trees and free trees, 2) Redundancy reduction: from the result of extraction, deleting redundant dependency structures such as sub-structures or equivalent structures of the others, and 3) Phrase/sentence reconstruction: generating a phrase or sentence in a natural language corresponding to the extracted structure. Our system is a combination of natural language processing techniques and tree mining techniques. The system consists of the following five units: 1) syntactic dependency analysis unit, 2) input filters, 3) characteristic ordered subtree extraction unit, 4) output filters, and 5) phrase/sentence reconstruction unit. Although ordered trees are extracted in the third unit, the overall behavior of the system can be switched into the extraction of ordered trees, unordered trees, or free trees depending on which of the input filters is/are applied in the second step. The output filters delete redundant trees from the extraction, result for efficient knowledge discovery. Finally, phrases or sentences corresponding to the extracted subtrees are reconstructed by utilizing the input documents. We demonstrate the validity of our system by showing experimental results using real data collected at a help desk and TDT pilot corpus.

17561;"Determining the semantic orientation of terms through gloss classification";0;"Esuli, A.a  and Sebastiani, F.b ";"Sentiment classification is a recent subdiscipline of text classification which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses. It has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. Functional to the extraction of opinions from text is the determination of the orientation of ""subjective"" terms contained in text, i.e. the determination of whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. In this paper we present a new method for determining the orientation of subjective terms.

17562;"Medical document categorization using a priori knowledge";0;"Itert, L.a  b  and Duch, W.b  c  and Pestian, J.a ";"A significant part of medical data remains stored as unstructured texts. Semantic search requires introduction of markup tags. Experts use their background knowledge to categorize new documents, and knowing category of these documents disambiguate words and acronyms. A model of document similarity that includes a priori knowledge and captures intuition of an expert, is introduced. It has only a few parameters that may be evaluated using linear programming techniques. This approach applied to categorization of medical discharge summaries provided simpler and much more accurate model than alternative text categorization approaches.

17565;"Text similarity measurement using concept representation of texts";0;"Pandya, A.a  and Bhattacharyya, P.b ";"Measuring semantic nearness of documents is important for accurate information retrieval, automated text categorization and classification. Inspired by the observation that text documents contain semantically coherent set of ideas/topics, this paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of a method to represent a text document as a set of concepts. Based on this, we propose a method to measure semantic nearness of texts. Our method makes use of WordNet which is a lexico-semantic network of words. We bypass word sense disambiguation. In order to show the effectiveness of our representation of texts, we compare experimental results of text classification and clustering with the results of classification and clustering with standard techniques.

However, the challenge lays in creating this semantic web and in converting existing web information into the semantic paradigm. One of the core technologies that can help in migration process is automatic markup, the semantic markup of content, providing the semantic tags to describe the raw content. This paper describes a hybrid statistical and knowledge-based information extraction model, able to extract entities and relations at the sentence level. The model attempts to retain and improve the high accuracy levels of knowledge-based systems while drastically reducing the amount of manual labor by relying on statistics drawn from a training corpus. The implementation of the model, called TEG (Trainable Extraction Grammar), can be adapted to any IE domain by writing a suitable set of rules in a SCFG (Stochastic Context Free Grammar) based extraction language, and training them using an annotated corpus. The experiments show that our hybrid approach outperforms both purely statistical and purely knowledge-based systems, while requiring orders of magnitude less manual rule writing and smaller amount of training data. We also demonstrate the robustness of our system under conditions of poor training data quality.

Beside textual features, the hierarchical structure of directories reflect additional and important knowledge annotated by experts. It is generally desired to incorporate this information into text mining processes. In this paper, we propose hierarchy-regularized latent semantic indexing, which encodes the hierarchy into a similarity graph of documents and then formulates an optimization problem mapping each document into a low dimensional vector space. The new feature space preserves the intrinsic structure of the original taxonomy and thus provides a meaningful basis for various learning tasks like visualization and classification. Our approach employs the information about class proximity and class specificity, and can naturally cope with multi-labeled documents.

17584;"Robust textual inference via learning and abductive reasoning";0;"Raina, R. and Ng, A.Y. and Manning, C.D.";"We present a system for textual inference (the task of inferring whether a sentence follows from another text) that uses learning and a logical-formula semantic representation of the text. More precisely, our system begins by parsing and then transforming sentences into a logical formula-like representation similar to the one used by (Harabagiu et al., 2000). An abductive theorem prover then tries to find the minimum ""cost"" set of assumptions necessary to show that one statement follows from the other. These costs reflect how likely different assumptions are, and are learned automatically using information from syntactic/semantic features and from linguistic resources such as WordNet. If one sentence follows from the other given only highly plausible, low cost assumptions, then we conclude that it can be inferred. Our approach can be viewed as combining statistical machine learning and classical logical reasoning, in the hope of marrying the robustness and scalability of learning with the preciseness and elegance of logical theorem proving.

17591;"Semantic context classification by means of fuzzy set theory";0;"Sun, Y. and Khoury, R. and Karray, F. and Basir, O.";"Comprehension of semantic meaning is at the heart of modern natural language processing (NLP). Currently, research in statistical NLP has focused primarily on the statistical representation of lexical combinational occurrences. Due to the limitations of current computer technology, however, representing a lexical combination is restricted to a finite length. As such, we focus attention on obtaining approximate but simpler and satisfactory solutions through soft computing techniques; in particular, the fuzzy set theory. It is difficult, however, to apply conventional fuzzy membership functions for general linguistic items. As such, we specifically propose a method of constructing membership functions for linguistic items based on the level of semantic patterns. For testing purpose, the proposed methodology is applied in text classification and the accompanying experimental results are compared with the output provided by a probabilistic based approach.

17592;"A comparative study for WordNet guided text representation";0;"Zhang, J. and Li, C.";"Text information processing depends critically on the proper text representation. A common and naÃ¯ve way of representing a document is a bag of its component words [1], but the semantic relations between words are ignored, such as synonymy and hypernymy-hyponymy between nouns. This paper presents a model for representing a document in terms of the synonymy sets (synsets) in WordNet [2]. The synsets stand for concepts corresponding to the words of the document. The Vector Space Model describes a document as orthogonal term vectors. We replace terms with concepts to build Concept Vector Space Model (CVSM) for the training set.

17598;"Support vector machine for customized email filtering based on improving latent semantic indexing";0;"Yang, Q.a  b  and Li, F.-M.a ";"Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is an important method for Information Retrieval (IR), in which we can automatically transform the original textual data to a smaller semantic space by take advantage of some of the implicit or latent higher-order structure in associations of words with customized objects, and it also has been successfully applied to text classification. LSI can resolve the problems of polysemy and synonymy, and can reduce noise in the raw document-term matrix. But LSI is not an optimal approach to text classification. Because LSI is a complete unsupervised method which ignores categories discrimination, it often drops the performance of text classification when it is applied to the whole training documents [1]. In this paper, in order to prevent the spreading of the unsolicited email and harmful message, under multi-languages (Chinese and English) circumstance we have developed a system based on customized email topic being filtered, and we represented topic in Latent Semantic model, and abstract features from predefined email categories and document categories in LSI method. It is able to filter and recognize customized or special unwanted Chinese and English emails in positive examples supervised learning approach. We propose an improving LSI to improve the classification performance by a separate Single Value Decomposition (SVD) on the transformed local region of each category. We apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method to recognize and filter email based on text classifier.

Many popular TC models use simple occurrence of words in a document as features. They also commonly assume word occurrences to be statistically independent in their design. Although it is obvious that such assumption does not hold in general, these TC models have been robust and efficient in their task. Some recent studies have shown context-sensitive TC approaches, which take into consideration contexts in the form of word co-occurrences, have been able to perform better in general. On the other hand, there have been many studies in the use of complex linguistic or semantic features instead of simple word occurrences as features for information retrieval and classification tasks. While these complex features may intuitively have more relevance to the tasks concerned, results of these studies on their effectiveness have been mixed and not been conclusive.

Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop psychiatric services that can automatically identify such events. This study describes the use of association language patterns, i.e., meaningful combinations of words (e.g., &lt;loss, job&gt;), as features to classify sentences with negative life events into predefined categories (e.g., Family, Love, Work). Methods This study proposes a framework that combines a supervised data mining algorithm and an unsupervised distributional semantic model to discover association language patterns. The data mining algorithm, called association rule mining, was used to generate a set of seed patterns by incrementally associating frequently co-occurring words from a small corpus of sentences labeled with negative life events. The distributional semantic model was then used to discover more patterns similar to the seed patterns from a large, unlabeled web corpus. Results The experimental results showed that association language patterns were significant features for negative life event classification. Additionally, the unsupervised distributional semantic model was not only able to improve the level of performance but also to reduce the reliance of the classification process on the availability of a large, labeled corpus.

17789;"A multi-layer text classification framework based on two-level representation model ";2;"Jiali Yun and Liping Jing and Jian Yu and Houkuan Huang";"Text categorization is one of the most common themes in data mining and machine learning fields. Unlike structured data, unstructured text data is more difficult to be analyzed because it contains complicated both syntactic and semantic information. In this paper, we propose a two-level representation model (2RM) to represent text data, one is for representing syntactic information and the other is for semantic information. Each document, in syntactic level, is represented as a term vector where the value of each component is the term frequency and inverse document frequency. The Wikipedia concepts related to terms in syntactic level are used to represent document in semantic level. Meanwhile, we designed a multi-layer classification framework (MLCLA) to make use of the semantic and syntactic information represented in 2RM model. The \{MLCLA\} framework contains three classifiers. Among them, two classifiers are applied on syntactic level and semantic level in parallel.

17790;"Semantic smoothing for text clustering";2;"Jamal A. Nasir and Iraklis Varlamis and Asim Karim and George Tsatsaronis";"Abstract In this paper we present a new semantic smoothing vector space kernel (S-VSM) for text documents clustering. In the suggested approach semantic relatedness between words is used to smooth the similarity and the representation of text documents. The basic hypothesis examined is that considering semantic relatedness between two text documents may improve the performance of the text document clustering task. For our experimental evaluation we analyze the performance of several semantic relatedness measures when embedded in the proposed (S-VSM) and present results with respect to different experimental conditions, such as: (i) the datasets used, (ii) the underlying knowledge sources of the utilized measures, and (iii) the clustering algorithms employed. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to systematically compare, analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic smoothing in text clustering based on wisdom of linguists, e.g., WordNets, wisdom of crowds, e.g., Wikipedia, and wisdom of corpora, e.g., large text corpora represented with the traditional Bag of Words (BoW) model. Three semantic relatedness measures for text are considered; two knowledge-based (Omiotis [1] that uses WordNet, and \{WLM\} [2] that uses Wikipedia), and one corpus-based (PMI [3] trained on a semantically tagged SemCor version). For the comparison of different experimental conditions we use the \{BCubed\} F-Measure evaluation metric which satisfies all formal constraints of good quality cluster. The experimental results show that the clustering performance based on the S-VSM is better compared to the traditional \{VSM\} model and compares favorably against the standard \{GVSM\} kernel which uses word co-occurrences to compute the latent similarities between document terms.

17792;"A Latent Semantic Indexing-based approach to multilingual document clustering ";2;"Chih-Ping Wei and Christopher C. Yang and Chia-Min Lin";"The creation and deployment of knowledge repositories for managing, sharing, and reusing tacit knowledge within an organization has emerged as a prevalent approach in current knowledge management practices. A knowledge repository typically contains vast amounts of formal knowledge elements, which generally are available as documents. To facilitate users navigation of documents within a knowledge repository, knowledge maps, often created by document clustering techniques, represent an appealing and promising approach. Various document clustering techniques have been proposed in the literature, but most deal with monolingual documents (i.e., written in the same language). However, as a result of increased globalization and advances in Internet technology, an organization often maintains documents in different languages in its knowledge repositories, which necessitates multilingual document clustering (MLDC) to create organizational knowledge maps. Motivated by the significance of this demand, this study designs a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)-based \{MLDC\} technique capable of generating knowledge maps (i.e., document clusters) from multilingual documents. The empirical evaluation results show that the proposed LSI-based \{MLDC\} technique achieves satisfactory clustering effectiveness, measured by both cluster recall and cluster precision, and is capable of maintaining a good balance between monolingual and cross-lingual clustering effectiveness when clustering a multilingual document corpus.

17793;"Exploiting noun phrases and semantic relationships for text document clustering ";2;"Hai-Tao Zheng and Bo-Yeong Kang and Hong-Gee Kim";"Text document clustering plays an important role in providing better document retrieval, document browsing, and text mining. Traditionally, clustering techniques do not consider the semantic relationships between words, such as synonymy and hypernymy. To exploit semantic relationships, ontologies such as WordNet have been used to improve clustering results. However, WordNet-based clustering methods mostly rely on single-term analysis of text; they do not perform any phrase-based analysis. In addition, these methods utilize synonymy to identify concepts and only explore hypernymy to calculate concept frequencies, without considering other semantic relationships such as hyponymy. To address these issues, we combine detection of noun phrases with the use of WordNet as background knowledge to explore better ways of representing documents semantically for clustering. First, based on noun phrases as well as single-term analysis, we exploit different document representation methods to analyze the effectiveness of hypernymy, hyponymy, holonymy, and meronymy. Second, we choose the most effective method and compare it with the WordNet-based clustering method proposed by others. The experimental results show the effectiveness of semantic relationships for clustering are (from highest to lowest): hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, and holonymy. Moreover, we found that noun phrase analysis improves the WordNet-based clustering method.

17795;"Semantic compared cross impact analysis ";2;"Dirk Thorleuchter and Dirk Van den Poel";"Abstract The aim of cross impact analysis (CIA) is to predict the impact of a first event on a second. For organizations strategic planning, it is helpful to identify the impacts among organizations internal events and to compare these impacts to the corresponding impacts of external events from organizations competitors. For this, literature has introduced compared cross impact analysis (CCIA) that depicts advantages and disadvantages of the relationships between organizations events to the relationships between competitors events. However, \{CCIA\} is restricted to the use of patent data as representative for competitor events and it applies a knowledge structure based text mining approach that does not allow considering semantic aspects from highly unstructured textual information. In contrast to related work, we propose an internet based environmental scanning procedure to identify textual patterns represent competitors events. To enable processing of this highly unstructured textual information, the proposed methodology uses latent semantic indexing (LSI) to calculate the compared cross impacts (CCI) for an organization. A latent semantic subspace is built that consists of semantic textual patterns. These patterns are selected that represent organizations events. A web mining approach is used for crawling textual information from the internet based on keywords extracted from each selected pattern. This textual information is projected into the same latent semantic subspace. Based on the relationships between the semantic textual patterns in the subspace, \{CCI\} is calculated for different events of an organization. A case study shows that the proposed approach successfully calculates the \{CCI\} for technologies processed by a governmental organization. This enables decision makers to direct their investments more targeted.

17796;"Genetic algorithm for text clustering based on latent semantic indexing ";2;"Wei Song and Soon Cheol Park";"In this paper, we develop a genetic algorithm method based on a latent semantic model (GAL) for text clustering. The main difficulty in the application of genetic algorithms (GAs) for document clustering is thousands or even tens of thousands of dimensions in feature space which is typical for textual data. Because the most straightforward and popular approach represents texts with the vector space model (VSM), that is, each unique term in the vocabulary represents one dimension. Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a successful technology in information retrieval which attempts to explore the latent semantics implied by a query or a document through representing them in a dimension-reduced space. Meanwhile, \{LSI\} takes into account the effects of synonymy and polysemy, which constructs a semantic structure in textual data. \{GA\} belongs to search techniques that can efficiently evolve the optimal solution in the reduced space. We propose a variable string length genetic algorithm which has been exploited for automatically evolving the proper number of clusters as well as providing near optimal data set clustering. \{GA\} can be used in conjunction with the reduced latent semantic structure and improve clustering efficiency and accuracy. The superiority of \{GAL\} approach over conventional \{GA\} applied in \{VSM\} model is demonstrated by providing good Reuter document clustering results.

Owing to the fact that short-text has inherent defects such as short length, weak signal and less features. It is hard to avoid noise words when doing feature extension which will highly influence the accuracy of classification. In order to solve the above problem, this paper proposes a semantic dictionary method for short-text classification. The method builds a set of domain dictionary by analyzing the specific characteristics in certain field. As each words weight in the dictionary is designed according to the correlation between the word and the category, classification accuracy has improved to some extent. Then, in order to enhance dictionary vocabulary coverage, association rules are utilized to automatically extend semantic dictionary. Finally, an experiment based on micro-blog data is conducted which shows that the method has a good effect.

Two types of weighted links between concepts are considered: one based on hyperlinks between the texts of the articles, and another one based on the lexical similarity between them. We propose and implement an efficient random walk algorithm that computes the distance between nodes, and then between sets of nodes, using the visiting probability from one (set of) node(s) to another. Moreover, to make the algorithm tractable, we propose and validate empirically two truncation methods, and then use an embedding space to learn an approximation of visiting probability. To evaluate the proposed distance, we apply our method to four important tasks in natural language processing: word similarity, document similarity, document clustering and classification, and ranking in information retrieval. The performance of the method is state-of-the-art or close to it for each task, thus demonstrating the generality of the knowledge resource. Moreover, using both hyperlinks and lexical similarity links improves the scores with respect to a method using only one of them, because hyperlinks bring additional real-world knowledge not captured by lexical similarity.

17800;"A concept-driven biomedical knowledge extraction and visualization framework for conceptualization of text corpora ";2;"Jahiruddin and Muhammad Abulaish and Lipika Dey";"A number of techniques such as information extraction, document classification, document clustering and information visualization have been developed to ease extraction and understanding of information embedded within text documents. However, knowledge that is embedded in natural language texts is difficult to extract using simple pattern matching techniques and most of these methods do not help users directly understand key concepts and their semantic relationships in document corpora, which are critical for capturing their conceptual structures. The problem arises due to the fact that most of the information is embedded within unstructured or semi-structured texts that computers can not interpret very easily. In this paper, we have presented a novel Biomedical Knowledge Extraction and Visualization framework, BioKEVis to identify key information components from biomedical text documents. The information components are centered on key concepts. BioKEVis applies linguistic analysis and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to identify key concepts. The information component extraction principle is based on natural language processing techniques and semantic-based analysis. The system is also integrated with a biomedical named entity recognizer, ABNER, to tag genes, proteins and other entity names in the text. We have also presented a method for collating information extracted from multiple sources to generate semantic network. The network provides distinct user perspectives and allows navigation over documents with similar information components and is also used to provide a comprehensive view of the collection. The system stores the extracted information components in a structured repository which is integrated with a query-processing module to handle biomedical queries over text documents. We have also proposed a document ranking mechanism to present retrieved documents in order of their relevance to the user query.

17801;"Quantitative cross impact analysis with latent semantic indexing";2;"Dirk Thorleuchter and Dirk Van den Poel";"Abstract Cross impact analysis (CIA) consists of a set of related methodologies that predict the occurrence probability of a specific event and that also predict the conditional probability of a first event given a second event. The conditional probability can be interpreted as the impact of the second event on the first. Most of the \{CIA\} methodologies are qualitative that means the occurrence and conditional probabilities are calculated based on estimations of human experts. In recent years, an increased number of quantitative methodologies can be seen that use a large number of data from databases and the internet. Nearly 80% of all data available in the internet are textual information and thus, knowledge structure based approaches on textual information for calculating the conditional probabilities are proposed in literature. In contrast to related methodologies, this work proposes a new quantitative \{CIA\} methodology to predict the conditional probability based on the semantic structure of given textual information. Latent semantic indexing is used to identify the hidden semantic patterns standing behind an event and to calculate the impact of the patterns on other semantic textual patterns representing a different event. This enables to calculate the conditional probabilities semantically. A case study shows that this semantic approach can be used to predict the conditional probability of a technology on a different technology.

17804;"Genetic algorithm for text clustering using ontology and evaluating the validity of various semantic similarity measures ";2;"Wei Song and Cheng Hua Li and Soon Cheol Park";"This paper proposes a self-organized genetic algorithm for text clustering based on ontology method. The common problem in the fields of text clustering is that the document is represented as a bag of words, while the conceptual similarity is ignored. We take advantage of thesaurus-based and corpus-based ontology to overcome this problem. However, the traditional corpus-based method is rather difficult to tackle. A transformed latent semantic indexing (LSI) model which can appropriately capture the associated semantic similarity is proposed and demonstrated as corpus-based ontology in this article. To investigate how ontology methods could be used effectively in text clustering, two hybrid strategies using various similarity measures are implemented.

17805;"Language independent semantic kernels for short-text classification ";2;"Kwanho Kim and Beom-suk Chung and Yerim Choi and Seungjun Lee and Jae-Yoon Jung and Jonghun Park";"Abstract Short-text classification is increasingly used in a wide range of applications. However, it still remains a challenging problem due to the insufficient nature of word occurrences in short-text documents, although some recently developed methods which exploit syntactic or semantic information have enhanced performance in short-text classification. The language-dependency problem, however, caused by the heavy use of grammatical tags and lexical databases, is considered the major drawback of the previous methods when they are applied to applications in diverse languages. In this article, we propose a novel kernel, called language independent semantic (LIS) kernel, which is able to effectively compute the similarity between short-text documents without using grammatical tags and lexical databases. From the experiment results on English and Korean datasets, it is shown that the \{LIS\} kernel has better performance than several existing kernels.

17806;"Towards role-based filtering of disease outbreak reports ";2;"Son Doan and Ai Kawazoe and Mike Conway and Nigel Collier";"This paper explores the role of named entities (NEs) in the classification of disease outbreak report. In the annotation schema of BioCaster, a text mining system for public health protection, important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases were conceptually analyzed with a formal ontological methodology and classified into types and roles. Types are specified as \{NE\} classes and roles are integrated into \{NEs\} as attributes such as a chemical and whether it is being used as a therapy for some infectious disease. We focus on the roles of \{NEs\} and explore different ways to extract, combine and use them as features in a text classifier. In addition, we investigate the combination of roles with semantic categories of disease-related nouns and verbs. Experimental results using naÃ¯ve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms show that: (1) roles in combination with \{NEs\} improve performance in text classification, (2) roles in combination with semantic categories of noun and verb features contribute substantially to the improvement of text classification. Both these results were statistically significant compared to the baseline raw text representation. We discuss in detail the effects of roles on each \{NE\} and on semantic categories of noun and verb features in terms of accuracy, precision/recall and F-score measures for the text classification task.

With these advances, connecting this equipment has become increasingly more complicated. Customer enquiries about problems such as no-connection to an Internet/phone service will increase, and telecom operators will require the ability to understand such situations and act as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is important to analyze failure trends and establish, in advance, effective coping processes for complex problems conveyed in customer enquiries. We present a method for analyzing and classifying customer enquiries efficiently and precisely from the structural type of description in ontologies. Moreover, our method can reconstruct semantic content efficiently by extracting related terms through analysis and classification. This method is based on a dependency parsing and co-occurrence technique to enable classification of a large amount of unstructured data into patterns because customer enquiries are generally stored as unstructured textual data. The validity of the method is evaluated and the method to determine threshold values is developed by using a large amount of customer enquiries in the real operational field.

Identifying the semantic orientation of subjective terms (words or phrases) is a fundamental task for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a new method for identifying the semantic orientation of subjective terms to perform sentiment analysis. The method takes a classification approach that is based on a novel semantic orientation representation model called S-HAL (Sentiment Hyperspace Analogue to Language). S-HAL basically produces a set of weighted features based on surrounding words, and characterizes the semantic orientation information of words via a specific feature space. Because the method incorporates the idea underlying \{HAL\} and the hypothesis verified by the method of semantic orientation inference from pointwise mutual information (SO-PMI), it can quickly and accurately identify the semantic orientation of terms without the use of an Internet search engine. The results of an empirical evaluation show that our method outperforms other known methods.

However, many online user reviews lack sufficient helpfulness votes for other users to evaluate their true helpfulness level. This study empirically examines the impact of the various features, that is, basic, stylistic, and semantic characteristics of online user reviews on the number of helpfulness votes those reviews receive. Text mining techniques are employed to extract semantic characteristics from review texts. Our findings show that the semantic characteristics are more influential than other characteristics in affecting how many helpfulness votes reviews receive. Our findings also suggest that reviews with extreme opinions receive more helpfulness votes than those with mixed or neutral opinions. This paper sheds light on the understanding of online users helpfulness voting behavior and the design of a better helpfulness voting mechanism for online user review systems.

17820;"A semantic graph-based approach to biomedical summarisation ";2;"Laura Plaza and Alberto DÃ­az and Pablo GervÃ¡s";"Objective Access to the vast body of research literature that is available in biomedicine and related fields may be improved by automatic summarisation. This paper presents a method for summarising biomedical scientific literature that takes into consideration the characteristics of the domain and the type of documents. Methods To address the problem of identifying salient sentences in biomedical texts, concepts and relations derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) are arranged to construct a semantic graph that represents the document. A degree-based clustering algorithm is then used to identify different themes or topics within the text. Different heuristics for sentence selection, intended to generate different types of summaries, are tested. A real document case is drawn up to illustrate how the method works. Results A large-scale evaluation is performed using the recall-oriented understudy for gisting-evaluation (ROUGE) metrics. The results are compared with those achieved by three well-known summarisers (two research prototypes and a commercial application) and two baselines. Our method significantly outperforms all summarisers and baselines. The best of our heuristics achieves an improvement in performance of almost 7.7 percentage units in the ROUGE-1 score over the LexRank summariser (0.7862 versus 0.7302). A qualitative analysis of the summaries also shows that our method succeeds in identifying sentences that cover the main topic of the document and also considers other secondary or â€œsatelliteâ€� information that might be relevant to the user. Conclusion The method proposed is proved to be an efficient approach to biomedical literature summarisation, which confirms that the use of concepts rather than terms can be very useful in automatic summarisation, especially when dealing with highly specialised domains.

To enable automated processing of the Web pages, semantic information such as metadata and tags regarding to each page should be added to it. Several authoring tools have been developed to help users tackling this task. However, manual or semi-automatic authoring is implausible when we intend to annotate large amount of Web pages. In this work, we proposed a method to automatically generate some descriptive metadata and tags for a Web page. The idea is to apply the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster the Web pages and discover the relationships between these clusters. In the mean time, the themes of each cluster are also identified. We then use such relationships and themes to tag the Web pages and generate metadata for the Web pages.

The systems potential is demonstrated with a corpus of 91,229 words from University of Denvers Penrose Library catalogue. The classification accuracy of the proposed LS-SVM based system is found to be over 99.9%. The final classifier is an LS-SVM array with Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) kernel, which uses the coefficients generated by the latent semantic indexing algorithm for classification of the text titles. These coefficients are also used to generate the confidence factors for the inference engine that present the final decision of the entire classifier. The system is also compared with a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classifier and the comparison clearly claims that the proposed LS-SVM based architecture outperforms the \{KNN\} and \{NB\} based system. The comparison between the conventional linear \{SVM\} based classifiers and neural network based classifying agents shows that the LS-SVM with \{LSI\} based classifying agents improves text categorization performance significantly and holds a lot of potential for developing robust learning based agents for text classification.

In turn, there are two types of \{LBD\} and LAD: open discovery systems (ODS), where one starts with a problem and arrives at a solution, and closed discovery systems (CDS), where one starts with a problem and a solution, then determines the mechanism(s) that links them.

17829;"Dealing with written language semantics by a connectionist model of cognitive reading";2;"J. Ignacio Serrano and M. Dolores del Castillo and A. Iglesias";"Although machines perform much better than human beings in most of the tasks, it is not the case of natural language processing. Computational linguistic systems usually rely on mathematical and statistical formalisms, which are efficient and useful but far from human procedures and therefore not so skilled. This paper proposes a computational model of natural language reading, called Cognitive Reading Indexing Model (CRIM), inspired by some aspects of human cognition, that tries to become as more psychologically plausible as possible. The model relies on a semantic neural network and it produces not vectors but nets of activated concepts as text representations. Based on these representations, measures of semantic similarity are also defined. Human comparison results show that the system is suitable to model human reading. Additional results also point out that the system could be used in real applications concerning natural language processing tasks.

The \{SVD\} reduces the noise contained in the original representation of the term-document matrix and improves the information retrieval accuracy. Recent studies indicate that \{SVD\} is mostly useful for small homogeneous data collections. For large inhomogeneous datasets, the performance of the \{SVD\} based text retrieval technique may deteriorate. We propose to partition a large inhomogeneous dataset into several smaller ones with clustered structure, on which we apply the truncated SVD.

17833;"Measuring prediction capacity of individual verbs for the identification of protein interactions ";2;"Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann and Antonio Jimeno-Yepes and Miguel Arregui and Harald Kirsch";"Motivation: The identification of events such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from the scientific literature is a complex task. One of the reasons is that there is no formal syntax to denote such relations in the scientific literature. Nonetheless, it is important to understand such relational event representations to improve information extraction solutions (e.g., for gene regulatory events). In this study, we analyze publicly available protein interaction corpora (AIMed, BioInfer, BioCreAtIve II) to determine the scope of verbs used to denote protein interactions and to measure their predictive capacity for the identification of \{PPI\} events. Our analysis is based on syntactical language patterns. This restriction has the advantage that the verb mention is used as the independent variable in the experiments enabling comparability of results in the usage of the verbs. The initial selection of verbs has been generated from a systematic analysis of the scientific literature and existing corpora for PPIs. We distinguish modifying interactions (MIs) such as posttranslational modifications (PTMs) from non-modifying interactions (NMIs) and assumed that \{MIs\} have a higher predictive capacity due to stronger scientific evidence proving the interaction. We found that \{MIs\} are less frequent in the corpus but can be extracted at the same precision levels as PPIs. A significant portion of correct \{PPI\} reportings in the BioCreAtIve \{II\} corpus use the verb â€œassociateâ€�, which semantically does not prove a relation. The performance of every monitored verb is listed and allows the selection of specific verbs to improve the performance of \{PPI\} extraction solutions. Programmatic access to the text processing modules is available online (www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit/info.jsf) and the full analysis of Medline abstracts will be made through the Web pages of the Rebholz group.

17834;"Fast text categorization using concise semantic analysis";2;"Zhixing Li and Zhongyang Xiong and Yufang Zhang and Chunyong Liu and Kuan Li";"Text representation is a necessary procedure for text categorization tasks. Currently, bag of words (BOW) is the most widely used text representation method but it suffers from two drawbacks. First, the quantity of words is huge; second, it is not feasible to calculate the relationship between words. Semantic analysis (SA) techniques help \{BOW\} overcome these two drawbacks by interpreting words and documents in a space of concepts. However, existing \{SA\} techniques are not designed for text categorization and often incur huge computing cost. This paper proposes a concise semantic analysis (CSA) technique for text categorization tasks. \{CSA\} extracts a few concepts from category labels and then implements concise interpretation on words and documents. These concepts are small in quantity and great in generality and tightly related to the category labels. Therefore, \{CSA\} preserves necessary information for classifiers with very low computing cost. To evaluate CSA, experiments on three data sets (Reuters-21578, 20-NewsGroup and Tancorp) were conducted and the results show that \{CSA\} reaches a comparable micro- and macro-F1 performance with BOW, if not better one. Experiments also show that \{CSA\} helps dimension sensitive learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) to eliminate the Curse of Dimensionality and as a result reaches a comparable performance with support vector machine (SVM) in text categorization applications. In addition, \{CSA\} is language independent and performs equally well both in Chinese and English.

A novel OntoPlus methodology is proposed for semi-automatic ontology extension based on text mining methods. It allows for the effective extension of the large ontologies, providing a ranked list of potentially relevant concepts and relationships given a new concept (e.g., glossary term) to be inserted in the ontology. A number of experiments are conducted, evaluating measures for ranking correspondence between existing ontology concepts and new domain concepts suggested for the ontology extension. Measures for ranking are based on incorporating ontology content, structure and co-occurrence information. The experiments are performed using a well known Cyc ontology and textual material from two domains â€“ finances and, fisheries &amp; aquaculture. Our experiments show that the best results are achieved by combining content, structure and co-occurrence information. Furthermore, ontology content and structure seem to be more important than co-occurrence for our data in the financial domain. At the same time, ontology content and co-occurrence seem to have higher importance for our fisheries &amp; aquaculture domain.

In this research, we explore completely automated on-the-fly verification of a membership in any arbitrary category which has not been expected a priori. Our approach does not rely on any manually codified knowledge (such as WordNet or Wikipedia) but instead capitalizes on the diversity of topics and word usage on the World Wide Web, thus can be considered knowledge-light and complementary to the knowledge-intensive approaches. We have created a quantitative verification model and established (1) what specific variables are important and (2) what ranges and upper limits of accuracy are attainable. While our semantic verification algorithm is entirely self-contained (not involving any previously reported components that are beyond the scope of this paper), we have tested it empirically within our fact seeking engine on the well known \{TREC\} conference test questions.

17850;"An Exploratory Study of Enhancing Text Clustering with Auto-Generated Semantic Tags";3;"Xuning Tang and Jiangbo Dang";"With the exponentially growing volume of digital documents and internet content, it becomes very challenging to locate right information when desired. We heavily rely on search engines but most existing search tools are key-word based and they often return search results with low precision and recall. The emerging semantic tagging technology provides an automatic way to generate semantic tags from text. It has drawn more and more interest from text mining research communities. It is critical to study how to utilize semantic tags to improve text mining including clustering, which helps users to enhance their experience of searching and browsing documents. Unfortunately, most previous works on text clustering merely based on content information. A few recent researches take user-generated tags into account, however user generated tags are often noisy, inconsistent, redundant and lack of semantic information and hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a Semantic Text Mining (STeM) framework to generate semantic tags for given documents and then utilize the semantic tags to improve text clustering. Different from the previous works, we represent a document by a combination of domains and high quality noun phrases.

Many researchers believe that the extension with semantic knowledge could improve the results and various methods (most of them are heuristic) have been proposed to account for concept hierarchy, synonymy, and other semantic relationships. However, the results with such semantic extension have been mixed, ranging from slight improvements to decreases in effectiveness, mostly likely due to the lack of a formal framework. Instead, we propose a novel method to address the semantic extension within the framework of language modeling. Our method extracts explicit topic signatures from documents and then statistically maps them into single- word features. The incorporation of semantic knowledge then reduces to the smoothing of unigram language models using semantic knowledge.

In this paper, we present a two-step procedure to mine generalized associations of semantic relations conveyed by the textual content of Web documents. First, RDF (resource description framework) metadata representing semantic relations are extracted from raw text using a myriad of natural language processing techniques. The relation extraction process also creates a term taxonomy in the form of a sense hierarchy inferred from WordNet. Then, a novel generalized association pattern mining algorithm (GP-Close) is applied to discover the underlying relation association patterns on RDF metadata. For pruning the large number of redundant overgeneralized patterns in relation pattern search space, the GP-Close algorithm adopts the notion of generalization closure for systematic overgeneralization reduction.

17862;"A WordNet-Based Semantic Model for Enhancing Text Clustering";3;"Shehata, S.";"Most of text mining techniques are based on word and/or phrase analysis of the text. The statistical analysis of a term (word or phrase) frequency captures the importance of the term within a document. However, to achieve a more accurate analysis, the underlying mining technique should indicate terms that capture the semantics of the text from which the importance of a term in a sentence and in the document can be derived. Incorporating semantic features from the WordNet lexical database is one of many approaches that have been tried to improve the accuracy of text clustering techniques. A new semantic-based model that analyzes documents based on their meaning is introduced. The proposed model analyzes terms and their corresponding synonyms and/or hypernyms on the sentence and document levels. In this model, if two documents contain different words and these words are semantically related, the proposed model can measure the semantic-based similarity between the two documents. The similarity between documents relies on a new semantic-based similarity measure which is applied to the matching concepts between documents. Experiments using the proposed semantic-based model in text clustering are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that the newly developed semantic-based model enhances the clustering quality of sets of documents substantially.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"HIGH";98;"2009";"Data Mining Workshops, 2009.

However, traditional word-frequency-based statistical approaches, such as VSM model, failed to reflect the complicated meaning in texts. This paper ushers in domain ontology and constructs new conceptual vector space model in the pre-processing stage of text clustering, substituting the initial matrix (lexicon-text matrix) in the latent semantic analysis with concept-text matrix. In the clustering analysis stage, this model adopts semantic similarity, partially overcoming the difficulty in accurately and effectively evaluating the degree of similarity of text due to simply taking into account the frequency of words and/or phrases in the text.

Such graph structure for textual representation consists of nodes and directed edges, which stand for the feature terms derived from the texts and the semantic relationships between them, respectively. Moreover, the weight is assigned to each edge so that the strength of relationship between two terms can be measured. For this weighted directed graph structure, a novel graph similarity algorithm is developed by extracting the maximum common subgraph between two concerned graphs, which can therefore be used to measure the distance between two graph structures, i.e. two texts, and finally be used to sort the texts into different clusters.

Then a set of additional reliable training data for data-sparse categories can be retrieved based on such representation and particular similarity metrics. This training data enhancement strategy is classifier independent and can improve the classification of categories without adequate training data. Second, we propose the occurrence probability based strategy for hierarchical text classification which can reduce error propagation efficiently.

Higher order relations in LSI capture ""latent semantics"". Inspired by this, a novel Bayesian framework for classification named Higher Order Nai¨ve Bayes (HONB), which can explicitly make use of these higher-order relations, has been introduced previously. We present a novel semantic smoothing method named Higher Order Smoothing (HOS) for the Naive Bayes algorithm. HOS is built on a similar graph based data representation of HONB which allows semantics in higher order paths to be exploited. Additionally, we take the concept one step further in HOS and exploited the relationships between instances of different classes in order to improve the parameter estimation when dealing with insufficient labeled data. As a result, we have not only been able to move beyond instance boundaries, but also class boundaries to exploit the latent information in higher-order paths.

A long-short trading strategy can earn significant positive cumulative excess returns in the following 10 days.

17912;"Inter-document reference detection as an alternative to full text semantic analysis in document clustering";3;"De Maziere, P.A. and Van Hulle, M.M.";"We discuss here the search for inter-document references as an alternative to the grouping of document inventories based on a full text semantic analysis. The used document inventory, which is not publicly available, was provided to us by the European Union (EU) in the framework of an EU project, the aim of which was to analyse, classify, and visualise EU funded research in social sciences and humanities in EU framework programmes FP5 and FP6. This project, called the SSH project for short, was aimed at the evaluation of the contributions of research to the development of EU policies. For the semantic based grouping, we start from a Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis of the document vectors, which is the result of a prior semantic analysis. As an alternative to a semantic analysis, we searched for inter-document references or direct references. Direct references are defined as terms that explicitly refer to other documents present in the inventory. We show that the grouping based on references is largely similar to the one based on semantics, but with considerably less computational efforts. In addition, the non-expert can make better use of the results, since the references are displayed as graphical webpages with hyperlinks pointing to both the referenced and the referencing document(s), and the reason of linkage. Finally, we show that the combination of a database, to store the data and the (intermediate) results, and a webserver, to visualise the results, offers a powerful platform to analyse the document inventory and to share the results with all participants/collaborators involved in a data- and computation intensive EU-project, thereby guaranteeing both data- and result-consistency.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"VERY_LOW";79;"2013";"Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP), 2013 IEEE International Workshop on";"data visualisation;database management systems;document handling;file servers;pattern clustering;EU funded research;EU project;European Union;FP5;FP6;Webserver;data-consistency;database;document clustering;document inventories;document vectors;full text semantic analysis;graphical webpages;humanities;hyperlinks;interdocument reference detection;multidimensional scaling analysis;result-consistency;semantic based grouping;social sciences;Databases;Europe;Semantics;Servers;Terminology;Text analysis;Vectors;HPC;Semantic Analysis;Text Mining;client-server infrastructure";;;;;"1-6";"10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661952";"1551-2541";"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"15/05/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"referencias entre documentos";"null";"null";"null";"null";"agrupamento";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

First, CoTraining is employed for filtering out the likely positive data from the unlabeled dataset U. Second, we got vectors of documents in positive set using semantic-based feature extraction, then found the strong positive from likely positive set which is produced in first step. Those data picked out can be supplied to positive dataset P. Finally, a linear one-class SVM will learn from both the purified U as negative and the expanded P as positive. Because of the algorithms characteristic of automatic expanding positive dataset, the proposed algorithm especially performs well in situations where given positive dataset P is insufficient.

This representation separates the content and context and adds a number of semantic structures that encapsulate inferred information. The expanded semantic graph approach facilitates finding additional matches, identifying and eliminating poor matches, and prioritizing matches based on how much new knowledge is provided. By focusing on information of interest, doing pre-processing, and reducing processing requirements, the approach is applicable to problems where related information of interest is sought across a massive body of free text documents. Key aspects of the approach include (1) expanding the nodes and edges through inference using DL-Safe rules, abductive hypotheses, and syntactic patterns, (2) separating semantic content into nodes and semantic context into edges, and (3) applying relatedness measures on a node, edge, and sub graph basis.

Then, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is used to group the texts into semantically related clusters. Only those clusters whose coherence is greater than a threshold value are displayed.

17929;"A Novel Conception Based Texts Classification Method";3;"Bai Rujiang and Liao Junhua";"Text classification has been widely used to assist users with the discovery of useful information from the Internet. However, current text classification systems are based on the ldquoBag of Wordsrdquo (BOW) representation, which only accounts for term frequency in the documents, and ignores important semantic relationships between key terms. To overcome this problem, previous work attempted to enrich text representation by means of manual intervention or automatic document expansion. The achieved improvement is unfortunately very limited, due to the poor coverage capability of the dictionary, and to the ineffectiveness of term expansion. Fortunately, DBpedia appeared recently which contains rich semantic information. In this paper, we proposed a method compiling DBpedia knowledge into document representation to improve text classification. It facilitates the integration of the rich knowledge of DBpedia into text documents, by resolving synonyms and introducing more general and associative concepts. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we have performed an empirical evaluation using SVM calssifier on several real data sets. The experimental results show that our proposed framework, which integrates hierarchical relations, synonym and associative relations with traditional text similarity measures based on the BOW model, does improve text classification performance significantly.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";122;"2009";"Advanced Science and Technology, 2009.

However, current text knowledge representation models either lose much knowledge [e.g., vector space model (VSM)] or have a high complex computation [e.g., latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)]; even some of them cannot be constructed automatically [e.g., web ontology language, (OWL)]. In this paper, a novel text knowledge representation model, power series representation (PSR) model, which has a low complex computation in text knowledge constructing process, is proposed to leverage the contradiction between carrying rich knowledge and automatic construction. First, concept algebra of human concept learning is developed to represent text knowledge as the form of power series. Then, degree-2 power series hypothesis is introduced to simplify the proposed PSR model, which can be automatically constructed with a lower complex computation and has more knowledge than the VSM and LDA. After that, degree-2 power series hypothesis-based reasoning operations are developed, which provide a more flexible reasoning ability than OWL and LDA. Furthermore, experiments and comparisons with current knowledge representation models show that our model has better characteristics than others when representing text knowledge.

The platform is developed using a multilingual vector space based on the latent semantic indexing (LSI) model, and utilizing collected professional Chinese-English parallel corpora for training the system model. These multilingual patent documents can then be mapped into the semantic vector space for evaluating their similarity by means of text clustering techniques.

We report our experience in developing a new text analytic system called MEDAT or Medical Exploratory Data Analysis over Text, which overcomes several problems in text mining. The MEDAT system employs an annotated semantic index with a large number of assertions (propositions). The semantic index is able to capture complex assertions which encapsulate conceptual relationships including their modifiers at a granular level. The index represents semantically equivalent sentences with the same symbols, a necessary component for KDD semantic queries, including semantic Boolean and correlation queries. The graphical user interface enables users to perform complex semantic analysis of the Roentgen corpus, consisting of 594,000 de-identified radiology reports with 4.3 million sentences, without having to learn a programming language.

This paper, concerned with these automated methods, attempts to improve Gloss Vector semantic relatedness measure for more reliable estimation of relatedness between two input concepts. Generally, this measure by considering frequency cut-off for big rams tries to remove low and high frequency words which usually do not end up being significant features. However, this naive cutting approach can lead to loss of valuable information. By employing point wise mutual information (PMI) as a measure of association between features, we will try to enforce the foregoing elimination step in a statistical fashion. Applying both approaches to the biomedical domain, using MEDLINE as corpus, MeSH as thesaurus, and available reference standard of 311 concept pairs manually rated for semantic relatedness, we will show that PMI for removing insignificant features is more effective approach than frequency cut-off.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";23;"2013";"Informatics and Creative Multimedia (ICICM), 2013 International Conference on";"Bioinformatics;Biomedical Text Mining;Computational Linguistics;Semantic Relatedness;UMLS";;;;;"196-201";"10.1109/ICICM.2013.41";;"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"07/08/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"similaridade semantica, selecao de atributos";"null";"null";"MeSH";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Medline";"biomedicina";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

(2) What is the relatedness between two terms and how to estimate it? We focus on the first question and present an in-depth investigation into the discrimination measures based on several information measures, which are widely used in a variety of applications. The relatedness measures are then naturally defined according to the individual discrimination measures. Some key points are made for clarifying potential problems arising from using the relatedness measures, and solutions are suggested. Two example applications in the contexts of text mining and information retrieval are provided.

18000;"Ensemble Similarity Measures for Clustering Terms";3;"Ittoo, A. and Maruster, L.";"Clustering semantically related terms is crucial for many applications such as document categorization, and word sense disambiguation. However, automatically identifying semantically similar terms is challenging. We present a novel approach for automatically determining the degree of relatedness between terms to facilitate their subsequent clustering. Using the analogy of ensemble classifiers in machine learning, we combine multiple techniques like contextual similarity and semantic relatedness to boost the accuracy of our computations. A new method, based on Yarowskypsilas word sense disambiguation approach, to generate high-quality topic signatures for contextual similarity computations, is presented. A technique to measure semantic relatedness between multi-word terms, based on the work of Hirst and St. Onge is also proposed.

This paper illustrates a novel fuzzy domain ontology mining algorithm for supporting real-world ontology engineering. In particular, contextual information of the knowledge sources is exploited for the extraction of high quality domain ontologies and the uncertainty embedded in the knowledge sources is modeled based on the notion of fuzzy sets.

18008;"Multi-task Semi-supervised Semantic Feature Learning for Classification";3;"Changying Du and Fuzhen Zhuang and Qing He and Zhongzhi Shi";"Multi-task learning has proven to be useful to boost the learning of multiple related but different tasks. Meanwhile, latent semantic models such as LSA and LDA are popular and effective methods to extract discriminative semantic features of high dimensional dyadic data. In this paper, we present a method to combine these two techniques together by introducing a new matrix tri-factorization based formulation for semi-supervised latent semantic learning, which can incorporate labeled information into traditional unsupervised learning of latent semantics. Our inspiration for multi-task semantic feature learning comes from two facts, i.e., 1) multiple tasks generally share a set of common latent semantics, and 2) a semantic usually has a stable indication of categories no matter which task it is from. Thus to make multiple tasks learn from each other we wish to share the associations between categories and those common semantics among tasks. Along this line, we propose a novel joint Nonnegative matrix tri-factorization framework with the aforesaid associations shared among tasks in the form of a semantic-category relation matrix. Our new formulation for multi-task learning can simultaneously learn (1) discriminative semantic features of each task, (2) predictive structure and categories of unlabeled data in each task, (3) common semantics shared among tasks and specific semantics exclusive to each task. We give alternating iterative algorithm to optimize our objective and theoretically show its convergence. Finally extensive experiments on text data along with the comparison with various baselines and three state-of-the-art multi-task learning algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"LOW";101;"2012";"Data Mining (ICDM), 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on";"learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;multiprogramming;pattern classification;classification;discriminative semantic features;high dimensional dyadic data;joint nonnegative matrix trifactorization framework;latent semantic models;multi-task semi-supervised semantic feature learning;semantic-category relation matrix;Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Iterative methods;Joints;Optimization;Semantics;joint nonnegative matrix tri-factorization;multi-task learning;semantic feature learning;semi-supervised learning;text classification";;;;;"191-200";"10.1109/ICDM.2012.15";"1550-4786";"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"07/08/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"selecao de atributos";"null";"null";"null";"null";"classificacao";"null";"LSA, LDA, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

In general, this task can be approached by applying domain specific ontologies, but a review of the literature shows that there is no universal dictionary, or ontology for this domain. To address this issue, we manually construct an ontology for extracting entities such as: animal disease names, viruses and serotypes. We then use an automated ontology expansion approach to extract semantic relationships between concepts. Such relationships include asserted synonymy, hyponymy and causality. Specifically, these relationships are extracted by using a set of syntactic patterns and part-of-speech tagging. The resulting ontology contains richer semantics compared to the manually constructed ontology. We compare our approach for extracting synonyms, hyponyms and other disease related concepts, with an approach where the ontology is expanded using GoogleSets, on the veterinary medicine entity extraction task.

It covers topics from Greek temples to contemporary hospitals and universities; from the design of individual construction elements such as window sills to large-scale town planning; from physics to design; from planning to construction. It also discusses architectural history and styles and a multitude of other topics, such as building conception, statics, and interior design. Not surprisingly, this project took longer than planned.

18025;"Semantic Computing of Moods Based on Tags in Social Media of Music";3;"Saari, P. and Eerola, T.";"Social tags inherent in online music services such as Last.fm provide a rich source of information on musical moods. The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";28;"2013";"Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on";"Affective Computing;Artificial Intelligence;Computing Methodology;Content Analysis and Indexing;Intelligent Web Services and Semantic Web;Modeling human emotion;Modeling structured;Multimedia databases;Ontology design;Sound and Music Computing;Web mining;textual and multimedia data";;;;"PP";"1-1";"10.1109/TKDE.2013.128";"1041-4347";"01/31/2014";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"07/08/2014";"1";"Y";"N";"representacao textual";"null";"null";"null";"null";"analise de sentimentos";"null";"null";"null";"null";"musica";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"
18026;"Semantic Predications for Complex Information Needs in Biomedical Literature";3;"Cameron, D. and Kavuluru, R. and Bodenreider, O. and Mendes, P.N. and Sheth, A.P.";"Many complex information needs that arise in biomedical disciplines require exploring multiple documents in order to obtain information. While traditional information retrieval techniques that return a single ranked list of documents are quite common for such tasks, they may not always be adequate. The main issue is that ranked lists typically impose a significant burden on users to filter out irrelevant documents. Additionally, users must intuitively reformulate their search query when relevant documents have not been not highly ranked. Furthermore, even after interesting documents have been selected, very few mechanisms exist that enable document- to-document transitions. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of assertions extracted from biomedical text (called semantic predications) to facilitate retrieving relevant documents for complex information needs. Our approach offers an alternative to query reformulation by establishing a framework for transitioning from one document to another.

We propose a feature-frequency-based method for measuring semantic relatedness which is needed in order to reduce the number of document features for the task of topic labelling. This method is evaluated against multiple human judgement experiments comprising two languages and three different resources. Overall the results show that social ontologies provide a rich source of terminological knowledge.

The same sentence can be used with or without presupposition, provided that all the relations between discourse referents are preserved. 3 types of transformations are employed: triggers removal, triggers synonymic replacements and introducing triggers where there were none. The key is formed as a hash table containing information about the original text, the number of transformed sentences and the triggers on which the transformations were based.

Those extracted semantic elements are used by latter algorithm that will render suggestions in which might contain new semantic elements for later use by domain users to enrich ontology. After extracting semantic elements, a ""document weighting algorithm"" is applied to get summary information of document with respect to all extracted semantic words and then to be stored in knowledge base which contains ontology and database to be used later in other applications.

The choice of normalization procedure is important, as it has a dramatic effect on downstream data analysis. Although many normalization procedures have been developed, comparison and evaluation of their performance is difficult. We present a method to evaluate normalization procedures by utilizing gene- gene associations derived from the biomedical literature via Latent Semantic Indexing. The functional coherence of co- regulated genes obtained from different normalized data sets is calculated in order to evaluate the effectiveness of each normalization procedure.

18117;"A Semidiscrete Matrix Decomposition for Latent Semantic Indexing Information Retrieval";4;"Kolda, Tamara G. and OLeary, Dianne P.";"The vast amount of textual information available today is useless unless it can be effectively and efficiently searched. The goal in information retrieval is to find documents that are relevant to a given user query. We can represent and document collection by a matrix whose (i, j) entry is nonzero only if the ith term appears in the jth document; thus each document corresponds to a columm vector. The query is also represented as a column vector whose ith term is nonzero only if the ith term appears in the query. We score each document for relevancy by taking its inner product with the query. The highest-scoring documents are considered the most relevant. Unfortunately, this method does not necessarily retrieve all relevant documents because it is based on literal term matching. Latent semantic indexing (LSI) replaces the document matrix with an approximation generated by the truncated singular-value decomposition (SVD). This method has been shown to overcome many difficulties associated with literal term matching. In this article we propose replacing the SVD with the semidiscrete decomposition (SDD). We will describe the SDD approximation, show how to compute it, and compare the SDD-based LSI method to the SVD-based LSI methods. We will show that SDD-based LSI does as well as SVD-based LSI in terms of document retrieval while requiring only one-twentieth the storage and one-half the time to compute each query. We will also show how to update the SDD approximation when documents are added or deleted from the document collection.";"ACCEPTED";"REJECTED";"VERY_LOW";21;"1998";"ACM Trans. Inf.

The shortcomings are mainly due to the fact that such units are often considered as extemporaneous combinations of words retrievable by means of statistical routines. On the contrary, several linguistic studies, also dating back to the 60s, show that multiword units, and mainly compound nouns, are almost always fixed meaning units, with specific formal, morphological, grammatical and semantic characteristics. Furthermore, these units can be processed as dictionary entries, thus becoming concrete lingware tools useful to achieve efficient semantic information retrieval (IR). Therefore, in this paper we will focus on CATALOGA®, an automatic IR software which retrieves terminological information from digitized texts without any human intervention. CATALOGA® is actually configured as a stand-alone software which can be integrated in Web sites and portals to be used online. More specifically, we will describe its lingware and software characteristics, discussing their usage as a possible solution to current IR software limitations.

However, the sparsity of data and the semantic sensitivity to context often hinder the classification performance of short texts. In order to overcome the weakness, we propose a unified framework to expand short texts based on word embedding clustering and convolutional neural network (CNN). Empirically, the semantically related words are usually close to each other in embedding spaces. Thus, we first discover semantic cliques via fast clustering. Then, by using additive composition over word embeddings from context with variable window width, the representations of multi-scale semantic units. 11Semantic units are defined as n-grams which have dominant meaning of text. With n varying, multi-scale contextual information can be exploited. in short texts are computed. In embedding spaces, the restricted nearest word embeddings (NWEs). 22In order to prevent outliers, a Euclidean distance threshold is preset between semantic cliques and semantic units, which is used as restricted condition. of the semantic units are chosen to constitute expanded matrices, where the semantic cliques are used as supervision information. Finally, for a short text, the projected matrix. 33The projected matrix is obtained by table looking up, which encodes Unigram level features. and expanded matrices are combined and fed into CNN in parallel.

Using WordNet, this method constructed a data structure of semantic-element information to characterize lexical semantic contents, and adjusted EM modeling to disambiguate word stems. Then, in the lexical-semantic space of corpus, lexical-semantic eigenvector of document representation was built by calculating the weight of each synset, and applied to a widely-recognized algorithm NWKNN. On text corpus Reuter-21578 and its adjusted version of lexical replacement, the experimental results show that the lexical-semantic eigenvector performs F1 measure and scales of dimension better than term-statistic eigenvector based on TF-IDF. Formation of document representation eigenvectors ensures the method a wide prospect of classification applications in text corpus analysis.

213246;"Semantic relation annotation for biomedical text mining based on recursive directed graph";5;"Chen, B.a  b  and LÃ¼, C.a  and Wei, X.a  and Ji, D.a ";"In this paper we propose a novel model â€œrecursive directed graphâ€� based on feature structure, and apply it to represent the semantic relations of postpositive attributive structures in biomedical texts. The usages of postpositive attributive are complex and variable, especially three categories: present participle phrase, past participle phrase, and preposition phrase as postpositive attributive, which always bring the difficulties of automatic parsing. We summarize these categories and annotate the semantic information. Compared with dependency structure, feature structure, being recursive directed graph, enhances semantic information extraction in biomedical field. The annotation results show that recursive directed graph is more suitable to extract complex semantic relations for biomedical text mining.

However, up to now, in the biomedical domain comparatively fewer corpus focus on semantic association among all tokens in a sentence. We proposed an annotation scheme based on feature structure theory for enriching biomedical domain corpora with token semantic association (TSA). There are 227 documents of the BioNLP GE ST training data annotated to form TSA corpus in which each annotated item shows a token semantic association that appears as a triple. The annotation of token semantic association has the potential to significantly advance biomedical text mining by providing rich token semantic information for NLP systems especially for the sophisticated IE systems, such as bio-event extraction.

213250;"Mining heart disease risk factors in clinical text with named entity recognition and distributional semantic models";5;"Urbain, J.a  b ";"We present the design, and analyze the performance of a multi-stage natural language processing system employing named entity recognition, Bayesian statistics, and rule logic to identify and characterize heart disease risk factor events in diabetic patients over time. The system was originally developed for the 2014 i2b2 Challenges in Natural Language in Clinical Data. The systems strengths included a high level of accuracy for identifying named entities associated with heart disease risk factor events. The systems primary weakness was due to inaccuracies when characterizing the attributes of some events. For example, determining the relative time of an event with respect to the record date, whether an event is attributable to the patients history or the patients family history, and differentiating between current and prior smoking status. We believe these inaccuracies were due in large part to the lack of an effective approach for integrating context into our event detection model. To address these inaccuracies, we explore the addition of a distributional semantic model for characterizing contextual evidence of heart disease risk factor events. Using this semantic model, we raise our initial 2014 i2b2 Challenges in Natural Language of Clinical data F1 score of 0.838 to 0.890 and increased precision by 10.3% without use of any lexicons that might bias our results.

213251;"Enhancement of Arabic text classification using semantic relations of Arabic WordNet";5;"Yousif, S.A.a  and Samawi, V.W.b  and Elkaban, I.a  and Zantout, R.c ";"Arabic text classification methods have emerged as a natural result of the existence of a massive amount of varied textual information (written in Arabic language) on the web. In most text classification processes, feature selection is crucial task since it highly affects the classification accuracy. Generally, two types of features could be used: Statistical based features and semantic and concept features. The main interest of this paper is to specify the most effective semantic and concept features on Arabic text classification process. In this study, two novel features that use lexical, semantic and lexico-semantic relations of Arabic WordNet (AWN) ontology are suggested. The first feature set is List of Pertinent Synsets (LoPS), which is list of synsets that have a specific relation with the original terms. The second feature set is List of Pertinent Words (LoPW), which is list of words that have a specific relation with the original terms. Fifteen different relations (defined in AWN ontology) are used with both proposed features. NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier is used to perform the classification process. The experimental results, which are conducted on BBC Arabic dataset, show that using LoPS feature set improves the accuracy of Arabic text classification compared with the well-known Bag-of-Word feature and the recent Bag-of-Concept (synset) features. Also, it was found that LoPW (especially with related-to relation) improves the classification accuracy compared with LoPS, Bagof- Word and Bag-of-Concept. Â© 2015 Suhad A. Yousif, Venus W.

213253;"Adaptive semantic tag mining from heterogeneous clinical research texts";5;"Hao, T.a  b  and Weng, C.a ";"Objectives: To develop an adaptive approach to mine frequent semantic tags (FSTs) from heterogeneous clinical research texts. Methods: We develop a ""plug-n-play"" framework that integrates replaceable unsupervised kernel algorithms with formatting, functional, and utility wrappers for FST mining. Temporal information identification and semantic equivalence detection were two example functional wrappers. We first compared this approachs recall and efficiency for mining FSTs from ClinicalTrials.gov to that of a recently published tag-mining algorithm. Then we assessed this approachs adaptability to two other types of clinical research texts: clinical data requests and clinical trial protocols, by comparing the prevalence trends of FSTs across three texts. Results: Our approach increased the average recall and speed by 12.8% and 47.02% respectively upon the baseline when mining FSTs from ClinicalTrials.gov, and maintained an overlap in relevant FSTs with the baseline ranging between 76.9% and 100% for varying FST frequency thresholds. The FSTs saturated when the data size reached 200 documents. Consistent trends in the prevalence of FST were observed across the three texts as the data size or frequency threshold changed. Conclusions: This paper contributes an adaptive tag-mining framework that is scalable and adaptable without sacrificing its recall. This component-based architectural design can be potentially generalizable to improve the adaptability of other clinical text mining methods.

213254;"Text Summarization Based on Sentence Selection with Semantic Representation";5;"Zhang, C. and Zhang, L. and Wang, C.-J. and Xie, J.-Y.";"Text summarization is of great importance to solve information overload. Salience and coverage are two most important issues for summaries. Most existing models extract summaries by selecting the top sentences with highest scores without using the relationships between sentences, and usually represent the sentences simply basing on lexical or statistical features. As a result, those models can not achieve salience or coverage very well. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization model called Sentence Selection with Semantic Representation (SSSR). SSSR ensures both salience and coverage by learning semantic representations for sentences and applying a well-designed selection strategy to select summary sentences. The selection strategy used in SSSR is to select sentences that can reconstruct the original document with least distortion by means of linear combination. Besides, we improve our selection strategy by reducing redundant information. Then we learn two semantic representations for sentences: (1) weighted mean of word embeddings, (2) deep coding. Both of them are semantic and compact, and can capture similarities between sentences. Extensive experiments on datasets DUC2006 and DUC2007 validate our model.

213256;"A corpus-based semantic kernel for text classification by using meaning values of terms";5;"Altinel, B.a  and Can Ganiz, M.b  and Diri, B.c ";"Text categorization plays a crucial role in both academic and commercial platforms due to the growing demand for automatic organization of documents. Kernel-based classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) have become highly popular in the task of text mining. This is mainly due to their relatively high classification accuracy on several application domains as well as their ability to handle high dimensional and sparse data which is the prohibitive characteristics of textual data representation. Recently, there is an increased interest in the exploitation of background knowledge such as ontologies and corpus-based statistical knowledge in text categorization. It has been shown that, by replacing the standard kernel functions such as linear kernel with customized kernel functions which take advantage of this background knowledge, it is possible to increase the performance of SVM in the text classification domain. Based on this, we propose a novel semantic smoothing kernel for SVM. The suggested approach is based on a meaning measure, which calculates the meaningfulness of the terms in the context of classes. The documents vectors are smoothed based on these meaning values of the terms in the context of classes. Since we efficiently make use of the class information in the smoothing process, it can be considered a supervised smoothing kernel. The meaning measure is based on the Helmholtz principle from Gestalt theory and has previously been applied to several text mining applications such as document summarization and feature extraction. However, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to use meaning measure in a supervised setting to build a semantic kernel for SVM. We evaluated the proposed approach by conducting a large number of experiments on well-known textual datasets and present results with respect to different experimental conditions. We compare our results with traditional kernels used in SVM such as linear kernel as well as with several corpus-based semantic kernels. Our results show that classification performance of the proposed approach outperforms other kernels.

213258;"A novel semantic smoothing kernel for text classification with class-based weighting";5;"Altinel, B.a  and Diri, B.b  and Ganiz, M.C.c ";"In this study, we propose a novel methodology to build a semantic smoothing kernel to use with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for text classification. The suggested approach is based on two key concepts; class-based term weighting and changing the orthogonality of vector space. A class-based term weighting methodology is used for transformation of documents from the original space to the feature space. This class-based weighting basically groups terms based on their importance for each class and consequently smooths the representation of documents. This is accomplished by changing the orthogonality of the Vector Space Model (VSM) with introducing class-based dependencies between terms. As a result, on the extreme case, two documents can be seen as similar even if they do not share any terms but their terms are similarly weighted for a particular class. The resulting semantic kernel can directly make use of class information in extracting semantic information between terms, therefore it can be considered as a supervised kernel. For our experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of the suggested kernel with a large number of experiments on benchmark textual datasets and present results with respect to varying experimental conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use class-based term weighting in order to build a supervised semantic kernel for SVM. We compare our results with kernels that are commonly used in SVM such as linear kernel, polynomial kernel, Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and with several corpus-based semantic kernels. According to our experimental results the proposed method favorably improves classification accuracy over linear kernel and several corpus-based semantic kernels in terms of both accuracy and speed.

213259;"A semantic approach for text clustering using WordNet and lexical chains";5;"Wei, T.a  and Lu, Y.c  and Chang, H.b  and Zhou, Q.a  and Bao, X.d ";"Traditional clustering algorithms do not consider the semantic relationships among words so that cannot accurately represent the meaning of documents. To overcome this problem, introducing semantic information from ontology such as WordNet has been widely used to improve the quality of text clustering. However, there still exist several challenges, such as synonym and polysemy, high dimensionality, extracting core semantics from texts, and assigning appropriate description for the generated clusters. In this paper, we report our attempt towards integrating WordNet with lexical chains to alleviate these problems. The proposed approach exploits ontology hierarchical structure and relations to provide a more accurate assessment of the similarity between terms for word sense disambiguation. Furthermore, we introduce lexical chains to extract a set of semantically related words from texts, which can represent the semantic content of the texts. Although lexical chains have been extensively used in text summarization, their potential impact on text clustering problem has not been fully investigated. Our integrated way can identify the theme of documents based on the disambiguated core features extracted, and in parallel downsize the dimensions of feature space. The experimental results using the proposed framework on reuters-21578 show that clustering performance improves significantly compared to several classical methods.

213262;"Learning a cross-lingual semantic representation of relations expressed in text";5;"Rettinger, A. and Schumilin, A. and Thoma, S. and Ell, B.";"Learning cross-lingual semantic representations of relations from textual data is useful for tasks like cross-lingual information retrieval and question answering. So far, research has been mainly focused on cross-lingual entity linking, which is confined to linking between phrases in a text document and their corresponding entities in a knowledge base but cannot link to relations. In this paper, we present an approach for inducing clusters of semantically related relations expressed in text, where relation clusters (i) can be extracted from text of different languages, (ii) are embedded in a semantic representation of the context, and (iii) can be linked across languages to properties in a knowledge base. This is achieved by combining multi-lingual semantic role labeling (SRL) with cross-lingual entity linking followed by spectral clustering of the annotated SRL graphs. With our initial implementation we learned a cross-lingual lexicon of relation expressions from English and Spanish Wikipedia articles. To demonstrate its usefulness we apply it to crosslingual question answering over linked data.

213265;"Text mining of news-headlines for FOREX market prediction: A Multi-layer Dimension Reduction Algorithm with semantics and sentiment";5;"Khadjeh Nassirtoussi, A.a  and Aghabozorgi, S.a  and Ying Wah, T.a  and Ngo, D.C.L.b ";"In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration. In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space. The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum. The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33%. On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

213266;"Text classification using genetic algorithm oriented latent semantic features";5;"Uysal, A.K. and Gunal, S.";"In this paper, genetic algorithm oriented latent semantic features (GALSF) are proposed to obtain better representation of documents in text classification. The proposed approach consists of feature selection and feature transformation stages. The first stage is carried out using the state-of-the-art filter-based methods. The second stage employs latent semantic indexing (LSI) empowered by genetic algorithm such that a better projection is attained using appropriate singular vectors, which are not limited to the ones corresponding to the largest singular values, unlike standard LSI approach. In this way, the singular vectors with small singular values may also be used for projection whereas the vectors with large singular values may be eliminated as well to obtain better discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate that GALSF outperforms both LSI and filter-based feature selection methods on benchmark datasets for various feature dimensions. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The presented method not only considers what kind of the semantic primitives that a text contains, but also takes account of the association relation of the semantic primitives.

213273;"Short text classification using semantic random forest";5;"Bouaziz, A.a  and Dartigues-Pallez, C.a  and Da Costa Pereira, C.a  and Precioso, F.a  and Lloret, P.b ";"Using traditional Random Forests in short text classification revealed a performance degradation compared to using them for standard texts. Shortness, sparseness and lack of contextual information in short texts are the reasons of this degradation. Existing solutions to overcome these issues are mainly based on data enrichment. However, data enrichment can also introduce noise. We propose a new approach that combines data enrichment with the introduction of semantics in Random Forests. Each short text is enriched with data semantically similar to its words. These data come from an external source of knowledge distributed into topics thanks to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. Learning process in Random Forests is adapted to consider semantic relations between words while building the trees. Tests performed on search-snippets using the new method showed significant improvements in the classification. The accuracy has increased by 34% compared to traditional Random Forests and by 20% compared to MaxEnt.

The analysis showed that using the vector space model on the basis of semantic fields is efficient in cluster analysis algorithms of authors texts in English fiction. The study of the distribution of authors texts in the cluster structure showed the presence of the areas of semantic space that represent the idiolects of individual authors. Such areas are described by the clusters where only one author dominates. The clusters, where the texts of several authors dominate, can be considered as areas of semantic similarity of authors styles. SVD factorization of the semantic fields matrix makes it possible to reduce significantly the dimension of the semantic space in the cluster analysis of authors texts. Using the clustering of the semantic field vector space can be efficient in a comparative analysis of authors styles and idiolects.

213275;"Higher-order smoothing: A novel semantic smoothing method for text classification";5;"Poyraz, M. and Kilimci, Z.H. and Ganiz, M.C.";"It is known that latent semantic indexing (LSI) takes advantage of implicit higher-order (or latent) structure in the association of terms and documents. Higher-order relations in LSI capture ""latent semantics"". These findings have inspired a novel Bayesian framework for classification named Higher-Order Naive Bayes (HONB), which was introduced previously, that can explicitly make use of these higher-order relations. In this paper, we present a novel semantic smoothing method named Higher-Order Smoothing (HOS) for the Naive Bayes algorithm. HOS is built on a similar graph based data representation of the HONB which allows semantics in higher-order paths to be exploited. We take the concept one step further in HOS and exploit the relationships between instances of different classes. As a result, we move beyond not only instance boundaries, but also class boundaries to exploit the latent information in higher-order paths. This approach improves the parameter estimation when dealing with insufficient labeled data. Results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the value of HOS on several benchmark datasets.

213276;"Fuzzy control GA with a novel hybrid semantic similarity strategy for text clustering";5;"Song, W.a  b  and Liang, J.Z.a  and Park, S.C.b ";"This paper proposes a fuzzy control genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with a novel hybrid semantic similarity measure for document clustering. Since the common clustering algorithms use vector space model (VSM) to represent document, the conceptual relationships between related terms being ignored, we use semantic similarity measures to solve this problem. In general, the semantic similarity measures can be extensively categorized into two kinds: thesaurus-based methods and corpus-based methods. However, in practice the corpus-based method is rather complicated to tackle. We propose and demonstrate a semantic space model (SSM) as the corpus-based method, where the appropriately reduced dimensions in SSM can capture the true relationship between documents in terms of concepts, rather than specific terms. Thus, the thesaurus-based method is combined with our SSM as a hybrid strategy to represent the semantic similarity measure. In GA field, the balance between the capability to converge to an optimum and the capacity to explore new solutions affects the success of search for the global optimum. We utilize a fuzzy control GA to adaptively adjust the influence between these two factors. Two textual data sets from Reuter document collection and 20-newsgroup corpus are tested in our experiments, and the results show that our fuzzy control GA combined with the hybrid semantic similarity strategy apparently outperforms the conventional GA, FCM and K-means with the traditional cosine similarity in VSM. Moreover, the superiorities of the fuzzy control GA and our hybrid semantic strategy are demonstrated by their better performance, in comparison with conventional GA with the same similarity measures.

213278;"Mining semantic structures from syntactic structures in free text documents";5;"Mousavi, H.a  and Kerr, D.b  and Iseli, M.a  and Zaniolo, C.b ";"The Web has made possible many advanced text-mining applications, such as news summarization, essay grading, question answering, and semantic search. For many of such applications, statistical text-mining techniques are ineffective since they do not utilize the morphological structure of the text. Thus, many approaches use NLP-based techniques, that parse the text and use patterns to mine and analyze the parse trees which are often unnecessarily complex. Therefore, we propose a weighted-graph representation of text, called Text Graphs, which captures the grammatical and semantic relations between words and terms in the text. Text Graphs are generated using a new text mining framework which is the main focus of this paper. Our framework, SemScape, uses a statistical parser to generate few of the most probable parse trees for each sentence and employs a novel two-step pattern-based technique to extract from parse trees candidate terms and their grammatical relations. Moreover, SemScape resolves co references by a novel technique, generates domain-specific Text Graphs by consulting ontologies, and provides a SPARQL-like query language and an optimized engine for semantically querying and mining Text Graphs.

Our approach considers all the nouns of a document and builds a semantic graph, such that it represents entire document. We think that our graph captures many properties of the text documents and can be used for different application in the field of text mining and NLP, such as keyword extraction and to know the nature of the document. Our approach to construct a semantic graph is independent of any language. We performed an experimental analysis to validate our results to extract keywords of document and to derive nature of graph. We present the experimental result on construction of graph on FIRE data set and present its application for keyword extraction and commenting on the nature of document.

213280;"Semantic enrichments in text supervised classification: Application to medical domain";5;"Albitar, S. and Espinasse, B. and Fournier, S.";"The use of semantics in supervised text classification can improve its effectiveness especially in specific domains. Most state of the art works use concepts as an alternative to words in order to transform the classical bag of words (BOW) into a Bag of concepts (BOC). This transformation is done through conceptualization task. Furthermore, the resulting BOC can be enriched using other related concepts from semantic resources. This enrichment may enhance classification effectiveness as well. This paper focuses on two strategies for semantic enrichment of conceptualized text representation. The first one is based on semantic kernel method while the second one is based on enriching vectors method. These two semantic enrichment strategies are evaluated through experiments using Rocchio as the supervised classification method in the medical domain, using UMLS ontology and Ohsumed corpus.

213287;"Mining semantic representation from medical text: A Bayesian approach";5;"Bino Patric Prakash, G.a  and Jacob, S.G.b  and Radhameena, S.b ";"Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the exploration and construction of systems that can learn from data. Machine learning trains the computers to manage the critical situations via examining, self-training, inference by observation and previous experience. This paper provides an overview of the development of an efficient classifier that represents the semantics in medical data (Medline) using a Machine Learning (ML) perspective. In recent days people are more concerned about their health and explore ways to identify health related information. But the process of identifying the semantic representation for the medical terms is a difficult task. The main goal of our work was to identify the semantic representation for the medical abstracts in the Medline repository using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

213288;"A semantic kernel for text classification based on iterative higher-order relations between words and documents";5;"Altinel, B.a  and Ganiz, M.C.b  and Diri, B.c ";"We propose a semantic kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM) that takes advantage of higher-order relations between the words and between the documents. Conventional approach in text categorization systems is to represent documents as a ""Bag of Words"" (BOW) in which the relations between the words and their positions are lost. Additionally, traditional machine learning algorithms assume that instances, in our case documents, are independent and identically distributed. This approach simplifies the underlying models, but nevertheless it ignores the semantic connections between words as well as the semantic relations between documents that stem from the words. In this study, we improve the semantic knowledge capture capability of a previous work in [1], which is called Ï‡-Sim Algorithm and use this method in the SVM as a semantic kernel. The proposed approach is evaluated on different benchmark textual datasets. Experiment results show that classification performance improves over the well-known traditional kernels used in the SVM such as the linear kernel (one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for text classification system), the polynomial kernel and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.

213291;"Mining meaning from text by harvesting frequent and diverse semantic itemsets";5;"Di Caro, L. and Boella, G.";"In this paper, we present a novel and completely-unsupervised approach to unravel meanings (or senses) from linguistic constructions found in large corpora by introducing the concept of semantic vector. A semantic vector is a space-transformed vector where features represent fine-grained semantic information units, instead of values of co-occurrences within a collection of texts. More in detail, instead of seeing words as vectors of frequency values, we propose to first explode words into a multitude of tiny semantic information retrieved from existing resources like WordNet and ConceptNet, and then clustering them into frequent and diverse patterns. This way, on the one hand, we are able to model linguistic data with a larger but much more dense and informative semantic feature space. On the other hand, being the model based on basic and conceptual information, we are also able to generate new data by querying the above-mentioned semantic resources with the features contained in the extracted patterns. We experimented the idea on a dataset of 640 millions of triples subject-verb-object to automatically inducing senses for specific input verbs, demonstrating the validity and the potential of the presented approach in modeling and understanding natural language.

Unfortunately, large scale systems cannot be easily machine-learned due to a lack of directly supervised data. We propose a method that learns to assign MRs to a wide range of text (using a dictionary of more than 70, 000 words mapped to more than 40, 000 entities) thanks to a training scheme that combines learning from knowledge bases (e.g. WordNet) with learning from raw text. The model jointly learns representations of words, entities and MRs via a multi-task training process operating on these diverse sources of data. Hence, the system ends up providing methods for knowledge acquisition and wordsense disambiguation within the context of semantic parsing in a single elegant framework.

213497;"Inferring a semantic representation of text via cross-language correlation analysis";5;"Vinokourov, A.a  and Shawe-Taylor, J.a  and Cristianini, N.b ";"The problem of learning a semantic representation of a text document from data is addressed, in the situation where a corpus of unlabeled paired documents is available, each pair being formed by a short English document and its French translation. This representation can then be used for any retrieval, categorization or clustering task, both in a standard and in a cross-lingual setting. By using kernel functions, in this case simple bag-of-words inner products, each part of the corpus is mapped to a high-dimensional space. The correlations between the two spaces are then learnt by using kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis. A set of directions is found in the first and in the second space that are maximally correlated. Since we assume the two representations are completely independent apart from the semantic content, any correlation between them should reflect some semantic similarity. Certain patterns of English words that relate to a specific meaning should correlate with certain patterns of French words corresponding to the same meaning, across the corpus. Using the semantic representation obtained in this way we first demonstrate that the correlations detected between the two versions of the corpus are significantly higher than random, and hence that a representation based on such features does capture statistical patterns that should reflect semantic information. Then we use such representation both in cross-language and in single-language retrieval tasks, observing performance that is consistently and significantly superior to LSI on the same data.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";54;"2003";"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84873588359&partnerID=40&md5=efb701b7dc44e4b7fa3ae4c5485c4b89";;;;;"02/25/2016";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"21/04/16";"2";"Y";"N";"representacao semantica";"null";"null";"null";"null";"representacao de conhecimento";"ingles, frances";"SVM";"accuracy";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"
222711;"Concept generalization and fusion for abstractive sentence generation";5;"Belkebir, R. and Guessoum, A.";"Text summarization is either extractive or abstractive. Extractive summarization is to select the most salient pieces of information (words, phrases, and/or sentences) from a source document without adding any external information. Abstractive summarization allows an internal representation of the source document so as to produce a faithful summary of the source. In this case, external text can be inserted into the generated summary. Because of the complexity of the abstractive approach, the vast majority of work in text summarization has adopted an extractive approach. In this work, we focus on concepts fusion and generalization, i.e. where different concepts appearing in a sentence can be replaced by one concept which covers the meanings of all of them. This is one operation that can be used as part of an abstractive text summarization system. The main goal of this contribution is to enrich the research efforts on abstractive text summarization with a novel approach that allows the generalization of sentences using semantic resources. This work should be useful in intelligent systems more generally since it introduces a means to shorten sentences by producing more general (hence abstractions of the) sentences. It could be used, for instance, to display shorter texts in applications for mobile devices. It should also improve the quality of the generated text summaries by mentioning key (general) concepts. One can think of using the approach in reasoning systems where different concepts appearing in the same context are related to one another with the aim of finding a more general representation of the concepts. This could be in the context of Goal Formulation, expert systems, scenario recognition, and cognitive reasoning more generally. We present our methodology for the generalization and fusion of concepts that appear in sentences. This is achieved through (1) the detection and extraction of what we define as generalizable sentences and (2) the generation and reduction of the space of generalization versions. We introduce two approaches we have designed to select the best sentences from the space of generalization versions. Using four NLTK1 corpora, the first approach estimates the ""acceptability"" of a given generalization version. The second approach is Machine Learning-based and uses contextual and specific features. The recall, precision and F1-score measures resulting from the evaluation of the concept generalization and fusion approach are presented. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

222712;"Unsupervised accent classification for deep data fusion of accent and language information";5;"Hansen, J.H.L. and Liu, G.";"Automatic Dialect Identification (DID) has recently gained substantial interest in the speech processing community. Studies have shown that the variation in speech due to dialect is a factor which significantly impacts speech system performance. Dialects differ in various ways such as acoustic traits (phonetic realization of vowels and consonants, rhythmical characteristics, prosody) and content based word selection (grammar, vocabulary, phonetic distribution, lexical distribution, semantics). The traditional DID classifier is usually based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM), which is employed as baseline system. We investigate various methods of improving the DID based on acoustic and text language sub-systems to further boost the performance. For acoustic approach, we propose to use i-Vector system. For text language based dialect classification, a series of natural language processing (NLP) techniques are explored to address word selection and grammar factors, which cannot be modeled using an acoustic modeling system. These NLP techniques include: two traditional approaches, including N-Gram modeling and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and a novel approach based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression classification. Due to the sparsity of training data, traditional text approaches do not offer superior performance. However, the proposed TF-IDF approach shows comparable performance to the i-Vector acoustic system, which when fused with the i-Vector system results in a final audio-text combined solution that is more discriminative. Compared with the GMM baseline system, the proposed audio-text DID system provides a relative improvement in dialect classification performance of +40.1% and +47.1% on the self-collected corpus (UT-Podcast) and NIST LRE-2009 data, respectively. The experiment results validate the feasibility of leveraging both acoustic and textual information in achieving improved DID performance.

We show how these pure mathematical metrics fall short to asses topics quality. Experiments were performed over a dataset of 21,863 text reclamation.

222717;"Learning semantic representation with neural networks for community question answering retrieval";5;"Zhou, G.a  and Zhou, Y.a  and He, T.a  and Wu, W.b ";"In community question answering (cQA), users pose queries (or questions) on portals like Yahoo! Answers which can then be answered by other users who are often knowledgeable on the subject. cQA is increasingly popular on the Web, due to its convenience and effectiveness in connecting users with queries and those with answers. In this article, we study the problem of finding previous queries (e.g., posed by other users) which may be similar to new queries, and adapting their answers as the answers to the new queries. A key challenge here is to the bridge the lexical gap between new queries and old answers. For example, ""company"" in the queries may correspond to ""firm"" in the answers. To address this challenge, past research has proposed techniques similar to machine translation that ""translate"" old answers to ones using the words in the new queries. However, a key limitation of these works is that they assume queries and answers are parallel texts, which is hardly true in reality. As a result, the translated or rephrased answers may not look intuitive. In this article, we propose a novel approach to learn the semantic representation of queries and answers by using a neural network architecture. The learned semantic level features are finally incorporated into a learning to rank framework. We have evaluated our approach using a large-scale data set. Results show that the approach can significantly outperform existing approaches. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

222718;"Performance and accuracy analysis of semantic kernel functions";5;"Manuja, M. and Garg, D.";"Purpose â€“ Syntax-based text classification (TC) mechanisms have been overtly replaced by semantic-based systems in recent years. Semantic-based TC systems are particularly useful in those scenarios where similarity among documents is computed considering semantic relationships among their terms. Kernel functions have received major attention because of the unprecedented popularity of SVMs in the field of TC. Most of the kernel functions exploit syntactic structures of the text, but quite a few also use a priori semantic information for knowledge extraction. The purpose of this paper is to investigate semantic kernel functions in the context of TC. Design/methodology/approach â€“ This work presents performance and accuracy analysis of seven semantic kernel functions (Semantic Smoothing Kernel, Latent Semantic Kernel, Semantic WordNet-based Kernel, Semantic Smoothing Kernel having Implicit Superconcept Expansions, Compactness-based Disambiguation Kernel Function, Omiotis-based S-VSM semantic kernel function and Top-k S-VSM semantic kernel) being implemented with SVM as kernel method. All seven semantic kernels are implemented in SVM-Light tool. Findings â€“ Performance and accuracy parameters of seven semantic kernel functions have been evaluated and compared. The experimental results show that Top-k S-VSM semantic kernel has the highest performance and accuracy among all the evaluated kernel functions which make it a preferred building block for kernel methods for TC and retrieval. Research limitations/implications â€“ A combination of semantic kernel function with syntactic kernel function needs to be investigated as there is a scope of further improvement in terms of accuracy and performance in all the seven semantic kernel functions. Practical implications â€“ This research provides an insight into TC using a priori semantic knowledge. Three commonly used data sets are being exploited. It will be quite interesting to explore these kernel functions on live web data which may test their actual utility in real business scenarios. Originality/value â€“ Comparison of performance and accuracy parameters is the novel point of this research paper. To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this type of comparison has not been done previously.

222719;"QueryGen: Semantic interpretation of keyword queries over heterogeneous information systems";5;"Bobed, C. and Mena, E.";"In the last years, users have become used to keyword-based search interfaces due to their ease of use. By matching input keywords against huge amounts of textual information and labeled multimedia files, current search engines satisfy most of users information needs. However, the principal problem of this kind of search is the semantic gap between the input and the real user need, as keywords are a simplification of the query intended by the user. Moreover, different users could use the same set of keywords to search different information; even the same user could do it at different times. The search system, before accessing any data, should discover first the intended semantics behind the user keywords, in order to return only data fulfilling such semantics. The use of formal query languages is not an option for non-expert users, so a semantic keyword-based search based on semantic interpretation of keyword queries could be the solution, i.e., a search that starts discovering the semantics intended for the input user keywords, and then only data relevant to that semantics are returned as answer. In this paper we present a system that performs semantic keyword interpretation on different data repositories. Our system (1) discovers the meaning of the input keywords by consulting a generic pool of ontologies and applying different disambiguation techniques; (2) once the meaning of each keyword has been established, the system combines them in a formal query that captures the semantics intended by the user, considering different formal query languages and possibilities that could arise, but avoiding inconsistent and semantically equivalent queries; and, finally, (3) after the user has validated the generated query that best fits her/his intended meaning, the system routes the query to the appropriate data repositories that will retrieve data according to the semantics of such a query. Experimental results show the semantic interpretation capabilities and the feasibility of our approach.

222726;"Quantifying StockTwits semantic terms trading behavior in financial markets: An effective application of decision tree algorithms";5;"Nasseri, A.A.a  and Tucker, A.b  and De Cesare, S.a ";"Growing evidence is suggesting that postings on online stock forums affect stock prices, and alter investment decisions in capital markets, either because the postings contain new information or they might have predictive power to manipulate stock prices. In this paper, we propose a new intelligent trading support system based on sentiment prediction by combining text-mining techniques, feature selection and decision tree algorithms in an effort to analyze and extract semantic terms expressing a particular sentiment (sell, buy or hold) from stock-related micro-blogging messages called ""StockTwits"". An attempt has been made to investigate whether the power of the collective sentiments of StockTwits might be predicted and how the changes in these predicted sentiments inform decisions on whether to sell, buy or hold the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index. In this paper, a filter approach of feature selection is first employed to identify the most relevant terms in tweet postings. The decision tree (DT) model is then built to determine the trading decisions of those terms or, more importantly, combinations of terms based on how they interact. Then a trading strategy based on a predetermined investment hypothesis is constructed to evaluate the profitability of the term trading decisions extracted from the DT model. The experiment results based on 122-tweet term trading (TTT) strategies achieve a promising performance and the (TTT) strategies dramatically outperform random investment strategies. Our findings also confirm that StockTwits postings contain valuable information and lead trading activities in capital markets. Â© 2015 The Authors.

222729;"CrowdPulse: A framework for real-time semantic analysis of social streams";5;"Musto, C. and Semeraro, G. and Lops, P. and Gemmis, M.D.";"The recent huge availability of data coming from mobile phones, social networks and urban sensors leads research scientists to new opportunities and challenges. For example, mining micro-blogs content to unveil latent information about people sentiment and opinions is drawing more and more attention, since it can improve the understanding of complex phenomena and paves the way to the development of new innovative and intelligent services. In this paper we present CrowdPulse, a domain-agnostic framework for text analytics of social streams. The framework extracts textual data from social networks and implements algorithms for semantic processing, sentiment analysis and classification of gathered data. The framework has been deployed in two real-world scenarios in order to identify the most at-risk areas of the Italian territory according to the content posted on social networks and to monitor the recovering state of the social capital of LAquilas city after the dreadful earthquake of April 20091, respectively. In both scenarios, the framework showed its effectiveness and confirmed the insight that the combination of technologies specifically designed for Big Data processing with state-of-the-art methodologies for semantic analysis of textual content can provide very interesting findings and permits the analysis of such phenomena in a totally new way.

222732;"An information extraction system for protein function prediction";5;"Taha, K.a  and Yoo, P.D.b ";"We present a Natural Language Processing extraction system called IESforPFP, which can retrieve useful information from biomedical abstracts. IESforPFP aims at enhancing the state of the art of biological text mining by applying novel linguistic computational technique. By retrieving significant patterns of associations between proteins and molecules from biomedical abstracts, IESforPFP can determine the functions of un-annotated proteins. The system determines the semantic relationship between each protein-molecule pair in sentences using novel semantic rules. It applies a semantic relationship extraction model that retrieves information from different structural forms of constituents in sentences. In the framework of IESforPFP, each protein p is represented by a vector of weights. Each weight reflects the significance of a molecule m in the biomedical abstracts associated with p. That is, each weight quantifies the likelihood of the association between m and p. IESforPFP determines the set of annotated proteins that is semantically similar to p by comparing their vectors. It then annotates p with the functions of these annotated proteins. We evaluated the quality of IESforPFP by comparing it experimentally with two other systems. Results showed marked improvement.

222734;"In the pursuit of a semantic similarity metric based on UMLS annotations for articles in PubMed Central Open Access";5;"Garcia Castro, L.J.a  and Berlanga, R.a  and Garcia, A.b  c ";"Motivation: Although full-text articles are provided by the publishers in electronic formats, it remains a challenge to find related work beyond the title and abstract context. Identifying related articles based on their abstract is indeed a good starting point; this process is straightforward and does not consume as many resources as full-text based similarity would require. However, further analyses may require in-depth understanding of the full content. Two articles with highly related abstracts can be substantially different regarding the full content. How similarity differs when considering title-and-abstract versus full-text and which semantic similarity metric provides better results when dealing with full-text articles are the main issues addressed in this manuscript. Methods: We have benchmarked three similarity metrics - BM25, PMRA, and Cosine, in order to determine which one performs best when using concept-based annotations on full-text documents. We also evaluated variations in similarity values based on title-and-abstract against those relying on full-text. Our test dataset comprises the Genomics track article collection from the 2005 Text Retrieval Conference. Initially, we used an entity recognition software to semantically annotate titles and abstracts as well as full-text with concepts defined in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLSÂ®). For each article, we created a document profile, i.e., a set of identified concepts, term frequency, and inverse document frequency; we then applied various similarity metrics to those document profiles. We considered correlation, precision, recall, and F1 in order to determine which similarity metric performs best with concept-based annotations. For those full-text articles available in PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA), we also performed dispersion analyses in order to understand how similarity varies when considering full-text articles. Results: We have found that the PubMed Related Articles similarity metric is the most suitable for full-text articles annotated with UMLS concepts. For similarity values above 0.8, all metrics exhibited an F1 around 0.2 and a recall around 0.1; BM25 showed the highest precision close to 1; in all cases the concept-based metrics performed better than the word-stem-based one. Our experiments show that similarity values vary when considering only title-and-abstract versus full-text similarity. Therefore, analyses based on full-text become useful when a given research requires going beyond title and abstract, particularly regarding connectivity across articles.

In parallel, specialized repositories are been developed, indexing numerous clinical and biomedical tools. The main drawback of such repositories is the difficulty in locating appropriate resources for a clinical or biomedical decision task, especially for non-Information Technology expert users. In parallel, although NLP research in the clinical domain has been active since the 1960s, progress in the development of NLP applications has been slow and lags behind progress in the general NLP domain. The aim of the present study is to investigate the use of semantics for biomedical resources annotation with domain specific ontologies and exploit Natural Language Processing methods in empowering the non-Information Technology expert users to efficiently search for biomedical resources using natural language. Methods: A Natural Language Processing engine which can ""translate"" free text into targeted queries, automatically transforming a clinical research question into a request description that contains only terms of ontologies, has been implemented. The implementation is based on information extraction techniques for text in natural language, guided by integrated ontologies. Furthermore, knowledge from robust text mining methods has been incorporated to map descriptions into suitable domain ontologies in order to ensure that the biomedical resources descriptions are domain oriented and enhance the accuracy of services discovery. The framework is freely available as a web application at (http://calchas.ics.forth.gr/). Results: For our experiments, a range of clinical questions were established based on descriptions of clinical trials from the ClinicalTrials.gov registry as well as recommendations from clinicians. Domain experts manually identified the available tools in a tools repository which are suitable for addressing the clinical questions at hand, either individually or as a set of tools forming a computational pipeline. The results were compared with those obtained from an automated discovery of candidate biomedical tools. For the evaluation of the results, precision and recall measurements were used. Our results indicate that the proposed framework has a high precision and low recall, implying that the system returns essentially more relevant results than irrelevant. Conclusions: There are adequate biomedical ontologies already available, sufficiency of existing NLP tools and quality of biomedical annotation systems for the implementation of a biomedical resources discovery framework, based on the semantic annotation of resources and the use on NLP techniques. The results of the present study demonstrate the clinical utility of the application of the proposed framework which aims to bridge the gap between clinical question in natural language and efficient dynamic biomedical resources discovery.

222737;"Integrating word embeddings and traditional NLP features to measure textual entailment and semantic relatedness of sentence pairs";5;"Zhao, J.b  and Lan, M.a  b  and Niu, Z.-Y.c  and Lu, Y.a  b ";"Recent years the distributed representations of words (i.e., word embeddings) have been shown to be able to significantly improve performance in many natural language processing tasks, such as pos-of-tag tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and sentiment polarity judgement, etc. However, previous tasks only involve a single sentence. In contrast, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of word embeddings in sentence pair classification or regression problems. Specifically, we propose novel simple yet effective features based on word embeddings and extract many traditional linguistic features. Then these features serve as input of a classification/regression algorithm in isolation and in combination. Evaluations are conducted on three sentence pair classification/regression tasks, i.e., textual entailment, cross-lingual textual entailment and semantic relatedness estimation. Experiments on benchmark datasets provided by Semantic Evaluation 2013 and 2014 showed that using word embeddings is able to significantly improve the performance and our results outperform the best achieved results so far.

222739;"A word distributed representation based framework for large-scale short text classification";5;"Yao, D.a  and Bi, J.a  and Huang, J.a  and Zhu, J.b ";"With the development of internet, there are billions of short texts generated each day. However, the accuracy of large scale short text classification is poor due to the data sparseness. Traditional methods used to use external dataset to enrich the representation of document and solve the data sparsity problem. But external dataset which matches the specific short texts is hard to find. In this paper, we propose a framework to solve the data sparsity problem without using external dataset. Our framework deal with large scale short text by making the most of semantic similarity of words which learned from the training short texts. First, we learn word distributed representation and measure the word semantic similarity from the training short texts. Then, we propose a method which enrich the document representation by using the word semantic similarity information. At last, we build classifiers based on the enriched representation. We evaluate our framework on both the benchmark dataset(Standford Sentiment Treebank) and the large scale Chinese news title dataset which collected by ourselves. For the benchmark dataset, using our framework can improve 3% classification accuracy. The result we tested on the large scale Chinese news title dataset shows that our framework achieve better result with the increase of the training set size.

222740;"SAUText - a system for analysis of unstructured textual data";5;"Protaziuk, G. and Lewandowski, J. and Bembenik, R.";"Nowadays, semantic lexical resources, like ontologies, are becoming increasingly important in many systems, in particular those providing access to unstructured textual data. Typically, such resources are built based on already existing repositories and by analyzing available texts. In practice, however, building new or enriching existing resources of such type cannot be accomplished without using an appropriate tool. In this paper the SAUText is presented; it is a new system which provides the infrastructure for carrying out research involving the usage of semantic resources and the analysis of unstructured textual data.

222744;"MWI-sum: A multilingual summarizer based on frequent weighted itemsets";5;"Baralis, E.a  b  and Cagliero, L.a  b  and Fiori, A.c  and Garza, P.a  b ";"Multidocument summarization addresses the selection of a compact subset of highly informative sentences, i.e., the summary, from a collection of textual documents. To perform sentence selection, two parallel strategies have been proposed: (a) apply general-purpose techniques relying on datamining or information retrieval techniques, and/or (b) perform advanced linguistic analysis relying on semantics-based models (e.g., ontologies) to capture the actual sentence meaning. Since there is an increasing need for processing documents written in different languages, the attention of the research community has recently focused on summarizers based on strategy (a). This article presents a novelmultilingual summarizer, namely MWI-Sum (Multilingual Weighted Itemsetbased Summarizer), that exploits an itemset-based model to summarize collections of documents ranging over the same topic. Unlike previous approaches, it extracts frequent weighted itemsets tailored to the analyzed collection and uses them to drive the sentence selection process. Weighted itemsets represent correlations among multiple highly relevant terms that are neglected by previous approaches. The proposed approach makes minimal use of language-dependent analyses. Thus, it is easily applicable to document collections written in different languages. Experiments performed on benchmark and real-life collections, English-written and not, demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than state-of-the-art multilingual document summarizers.

One of the critical challenges faced the application of TCBR is responding to enormous requests from users in acceptable performance. Another challenge is the complexity of adapting Arabic language. The main contribution of this paper is proposing an enhanced version of SOPHIA-TCBR, which provides higher accuracy and better time performance. The proposed approach is evaluated in the domain of Arabic Islamic Jurisprudence (fiqh), which is a challenge case study with its large case-base and enormous number of users requests (questions) daily.

222749;"On-line text mining and recommendation based on ontology and implied sentiment inclination";5;"Yang, H.a  b  and Wang, Z.a  and Xu, H.a ";"Most of the exist Web search engines utilize matching the query keywords to pieces of information approach to identify of the data satisfying users request. These methods are not only inefficient, but also wasted a lot of users time to find a satisfactory results. In order to improve the problem above, we presented a different approach to identify users request that attracts more interest is called a ontology-based and implied sentiment search. Ontology is a tree structure which represent specifications of concepts and relations among them. Ontology play a central role in semantic web applications by providing a shared knowledge about the objects in real world. This paper proposes a method for determining semantic similarity between concepts and implied sentiment defined in ontology. Unlike method exist that use ontological definition of concepts for similarity assessment, the presented approach also focuses on the relations between concepts and their implied sentiment inclination. Our method is able to determine similarity not only at the definition level, but also is able to evaluate similarity of implied sentiment of information that are instances of concepts. In addition, the method allows for context-aware similarity assessment. Experimental comparison of our on-line text mining approach against other techniques known in the literature shows satisfying results.

222750;"A framework for multi-document abstractive summarization based on semantic role labelling";5;"Khan, A.a  and Salim, N.a  and Jaya Kumar, Y.b ";"We propose a framework for abstractive summarization of multi-documents, which aims to select contents of summary not from the source document sentences but from the semantic representation of the source documents. In this framework, contents of the source documents are represented by predicate argument structures by employing semantic role labeling. Content selection for summary is made by ranking the predicate argument structures based on optimized features, and using language generation for generating sentences from predicate argument structures. Our proposed framework differs from other abstractive summarization approaches in a few aspects. First, it employs semantic role labeling for semantic representation of text. Secondly, it analyzes the source text semantically by utilizing semantic similarity measure in order to cluster semantically similar predicate argument structures across the text; and finally it ranks the predicate argument structures based on features weighted by genetic algorithm (GA). Experiment of this study is carried out using DUC-2002, a standard corpus for text summarization. Results indicate that the proposed approach performs better than other summarization systems.

Micro logs as emerging opinion sharing platforms require new approaches that are more scalable and accurate. In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate SSSA, a Semantic Scoring Sentiment Analysis service, which matches the demand of scalability and efficiency of a sentiment analysis system for a large volume of micro logs. We first build an automated tweet tagging system to alleviate the cost of building a dataset for training. Our approach then calculates semantic scores of words in tweets. These scores are the baseline for the proposed subjectivity classification and feature selection steps. Finally, we build a polarity classifier to estimate the polarity of subjective tweets on top of them. Experiments show that SSSA, compared to conventional approaches that based on emoticon, hash tag, or semantic scoring, has improved the scalability and accuracy of micro log sentiment analysis.

222752;"Topic category analysis on twitter via cross-media strategy";5;"Cho, S.W. and Cha, M. and Sohn, K.-A.";"The growing popularity of social media provides a huge volume of social data including Tweets. These collections of social data can be potentially useful, but the extent of meaningful data in these collections has not been sufficiently researched, especially in South Korea Twitter data. In general, the South Korea Twitter data has been researched as a source of political media. Nonetheless, previous research on South Korea Twitter data has not adequately covered what kind of trend Twitter represents in terms of major topic categories such as politics, economics, or sports. In this paper, we present a cross-media approach to define the nature of South Korea Tweets by inferring the topic category distribution through short-text categorization. We select newspapers as cross-media, examine the categorization of news articles from major newspapers, and then train our classifier based on the features from each topic category. In addition, for grafting news topics onto South Korea Tweets, we propose a word clustering and filtering approach to exclude those words that do not provide semantic content for the topic categories. Based on the proposed procedures, we analyze the South Korea Tweets to determine the primary topic category focus of Twitter users. We observe the special behaviors of the South Korea Twitter users based on various parameters such as date, time slot, and day of the week. Because our research includes a macroscopic analysis of Twitter data using a cross-media strategy, our research can provide useful resources for other social media analysis as well.

In this research, attributes are extracted in two levels. The first level document representation based on distribution of compact noun were constructed and relevance measure is applied on the distributed compact noun-document representation. it is used evaluate the importance of the noun. It has been widely studied in supervised learning, whereas it is still relatively rare researched in unsupervised learning. Vector Space Model has been used in many text mining tasks, where it has achieved good results as well as acceptable computational complexity. So the proposed document representations are exploited the nf-idf style equation. In this work, distributional nouns are selected into three different ways. First method, the distributed nouns are integrated with relevance measures, and secondly, relevance based distributional nouns are incorporated with Heuristic function to find importance of attributes. The distributional noun representations are used to discriminate the Nouns and measure the semantic similarity between documents. This proposed feature selection method have been successfully applied for Text clustering with flocking algorithm, HCLK Means Clustering and evaluated the efficiency of our Document representation with both synthetic and a real datasets. It is found that the proposed algorithm identifies better feature sets and improves the clustering quality.

222762;"Curatable Named-Entity Recognition Using Semantic Relations";5;"Hsu, Y.-Y. and Kao, H.-Y.";"Named-entity recognition (NER) plays an important role in the development of biomedical databases. However, the existing NER tools produce multifarious named-entities which may result in both curatable and non-curatable markers. To facilitate biocuration with a straightforward approach, classifying curatable named-entities is helpful with regard to accelerating the biocuration workflow. Co-occurrence Interaction Nexus with Named-entity Recognition (CoINNER) is a web-based tool that allows users to identify genes, chemicals, diseases, and action term mentions in the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD). To further discover interactions, CoINNER uses multiple advanced algorithms to recognize the mentions in the BioCreative IV CTD Track. CoINNER is developed based on a prototype system that annotated gene, chemical, and disease mentions in PubMed abstracts at BioCreative 2012 Track I (literature triage). We extended our previous system in developing CoINNER. The pre-tagging results of CoINNER were developed based on the state-of-the-art named entity recognition tools in BioCreative III. Next, a method based on conditional random fields (CRFs) is proposed to predict chemical and disease mentions in the articles. Finally, action term mentions were collected by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). At the BioCreative IV CTD Track, the best F-measures reached for gene/protein, chemical/drug and disease NER were 54 percent while CoINNER achieved a 61.5 percent F-measure.

Part of the motivation is based on the fact that existing studies on the value attributes of hybrid offerings are mostly conceptual and need to be further substantiated through more systematic empirical studies. The research includes two samples with a total of 83 product-driven firms selected among the top R&D spenders in Canada and Europe. It adopts an innovative methodology based on online textual data that could be implemented in advanced business intelligence tools aiming at the facilitation of innovation, marketing and business decision making. Combinations of keywords referring to different aspects of service value were designed and used in a web search resulting in the frequency of their use on companies websites. Principal component analysis was applied to identify distinctive groups of keyword combinations that were interpreted in terms of specific service value attributes. Finally, the firms were classified by means of K-means cluster analysis in order to identify the firms with a high degree of articulation of their service value attributes. This work articulates a relatively simple and intuitive method for quantitative and qualitative semantic analysis of online textual data that is similar to latent semantic analysis but could be used as part of more user-friendly expert system solutions and business intelligence tools based on easily accessible business statistics packages. The results show that the main service value attributes of the Canadian firms are: better service effectiveness, higher market share, higher service quality, and customer satisfaction. The service value attributes for the European firms include, among others, product added-value, product modernization and optimization of customer time and efforts. Canadian firms focus on collaboration and co-creation with suppliers and customers for the sake of product-service innovation as a competitive advantage on the marketplace. On the other hand, the focus of EU firms on innovative hybrid offerings is not explicitly related to business differentiation and competitiveness. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

222766;"Predicting Temporal Intention in Resource Sharing";5;"SalahEldeen, H.M. and Nelson, M.L.";"When users post links to web pages in Twitter there is a time delta between when the post was shared (t tweet ) and when it was read (t click ). Ideally, when this time delta is small there is often no change in the pages state. However upon reading shared content in the past and due to the dynamic nature of the web, the pages state could change and the intention of the author need to be inferred. In this work, we enhance a prior temporal intention model and tackle its shortcomings by incorporating extended linguistic feature analysis, replacing the prior textual similarity measure with semantic similarity one based on latent topic detection trained on Wikipedia English corpus, and finally by enriching and balancing the training dataset. We uncovered three different intention behaviors in respect to time: Stable Intention, Changing Intention from current to past, and Undefined intention. Using these classes and only the information available at posting time from the tweet and the current state of the resource, we correctly predict the temporal intention classification and strength with 77% accuracy.

222770;"Mining quality phrases from massive text corpora";5;"Liu, J.a  and Shang, J.a  and Wang, C.b  and Ren, X.a  and Han, J.a ";"Text data are ubiquitous and play an essential role in big data applications. However, text data are mostly unstructured. Transforming unstructured text into structured units (e.g., semantically meaningful phrases) will substantially reduce semantic ambiguity and enhance the power and efficiency at manipulating such data using database technology. Thus mining quality phrases is a critical research problem in the field of databases. In this paper, we propose a new framework that extracts quality phrases from text corpora integrated with phrasal segmentation. The framework requires only limited training but the quality of phrases so generated is close to human judgment. Moreover, the method is scalable: both computation time and required space grow linearly as corpus size increases. Our experiments on large text corpora demonstrate the quality and efficiency of the new method.

222773;"Quantitative quality control from qualitative data: control charts with latent semantic analysis";5;"Ashton, T.a  and Evangelopoulos, N.b  and Prybutok, V.R.b ";"Large quantities of data, often referred to as big data, are now held by companies. This big data includes statements of customer opinion regarding product or service quality in an unstructured textual form. While many tools exist to extract meaningful information from big data, automation tools do not exist to monitor the ongoing conceptual content of that data. We use latent semantic analysis to extract concept factors related to service quality categories. Customer comments found in the data that express dissatisfaction are then considered as representing a non-conforming observation in a process. Once factors are extracted, proportions of nonconformities for service quality failure categories are plotted on a control chart. The results are easily interpreted and the approach allows for the quantitative evaluation of customer acceptance of system process improvement initiatives.

BioASQ assesses the ability of systems to semantically index very large numbers of biomedical scientific articles, and to return concise and user-understandable answers to given natural language questions by combining information from biomedical articles and ontologies. Results: The 2013 BioASQ competition comprised two tasks, Task 1a and Task 1b. In Task 1a participants were asked to automatically annotate new PubMed documents with MeSH headings. Twelve teams participated in Task 1a, with a total of 46 system runs submitted, and one of the teams performing consistently better than the MTI indexer used by NLM to suggest MeSH headings to curators. Task 1b used benchmark datasets containing 29 development and 282 test English questions, along with gold standard (reference) answers, prepared by a team of biomedical experts from around Europe and participants had to automatically produce answers. Three teams participated in Task 1b, with 11 system runs. The BioASQ infrastructure, including benchmark datasets, evaluation mechanisms, and the results of the participants and baseline methods, is publicly available. Conclusions: A publicly available evaluation infrastructure for biomedical semantic indexing and QA has been developed, which includes benchmark datasets, and can be used to evaluate systems that: assign MeSH headings to published articles or to English questions; retrieve relevant RDF triples from ontologies, relevant articles and snippets from PubMed Central; produce ""exact"" and paragraph-sized ""ideal"" answers (summaries). The results of the systems that participated in the 2013 BioASQ competition are promising. In Task 1a one of the systems performed consistently better from the NLMs MTI indexer. In Task 1b the systems received high scores in the manual evaluation of the ""ideal"" answers; hence, they produced high quality summaries as answers. Overall, BioASQ helped obtain a unified view of how techniques from text classification, semantic indexing, document and passage retrieval, question answering, and text summarization can be combined to allow biomedical experts to obtain concise, user-understandable answers to questions reflecting their real information needs.

222777;"Feature engineering for MEDLINE citation categorization with MeSH";5;"Jimeno Yepes, A.J.a  b  and Plaza, L.c  and Carrillo-de-Albornoz, J.c  and Mork, J.G.b  and Aronson, A.R.b ";"Background: Research in biomedical text categorization has mostly used the bag-of-words representation. Other more sophisticated representations of text based on syntactic, semantic and argumentative properties have been less studied. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of different text representations of biomedical texts as features for reproducing the MeSH annotations of some of the most frequent MeSH headings. In addition to unigrams and bigrams, these features include noun phrases, citation meta-data, citation structure, and semantic annotation of the citations. Results: Traditional features like unigrams and bigrams exhibit strong performance compared to other feature sets. Little or no improvement is obtained when using meta-data or citation structure. Noun phrases are too sparse and thus have lower performance compared to more traditional features. Conceptual annotation of the texts by MetaMap shows similar performance compared to unigrams, but adding concepts from the UMLS taxonomy does not improve the performance of using only mapped concepts. The combination of all the features performs largely better than any individual feature set considered. In addition, this combination improves the performance of a state-of-the-art MeSH indexer. Concerning the machine learning algorithms, we find that those that are more resilient to class imbalance largely obtain better performance. Conclusions: We conclude that even though traditional features such as unigrams and bigrams have strong performance compared to other features, it is possible to combine them to effectively improve the performance of the bag-of-words representation. We have also found that the combination of the learning algorithm and feature sets has an influence in the overall performance of the system. Moreover, using learning algorithms resilient to class imbalance largely improves performance. However, when using a large set of features, consideration needs to be taken with algorithms due to the risk of over-fitting. Specific combinations of learning algorithms and features for individual MeSH headings could further increase the performance of an indexing system.

222778;"Word Embedding Composition for Data Imbalances in Sentiment and Emotion Classification";5;"Xu, R.a  and Chen, T.a  and Xia, Y.b  and Lu, Q.c  and Liu, B.a  and Wang, X.a ";"Text classification often faces the problem of imbalanced training data. This is true in sentiment analysis and particularly prominent in emotion classification where multiple emotion categories are very likely to produce naturally skewed training data. Different sampling methods have been proposed to improve classification performance by reducing the imbalance ratio between training classes. However, data sparseness and the small disjunct problem remain obstacles in generating new samples for minority classes when the data are skewed and limited. Methods to produce meaningful samples for smaller classes rather than simple duplication are essential in overcoming this problem. In this paper, we present an oversampling method based on word embedding compositionality which produces meaningful balanced training data. We first use a large corpus to train a continuous skip-gram model to form a word embedding model maintaining the syntactic and semantic integrity of the word features. Then, a compositional algorithm based on recursive neural tensor networks is used to construct sentence vectors based on the word embedding model. Finally, we use the SMOTE algorithm as an oversampling method to generate samples for the minority classes and produce a fully balanced training set. Evaluation results on two quite different tasks show that the feature composition method and the oversampling method are both important in obtaining improved classification results. Our method effectively addresses the data imbalance issue and consequently achieves improved results for both sentiment and emotion classification.

Most of the previous studies on relation extraction from biomedical literature have focused on specific or predefined types of relations, which inherently limits the types of the extracted relations. With the aim of fully leveraging the knowledge described in the literature, we address much broader types of semantic relations using a single extraction framework. Results: Our system, which we name PASMED, extracts diverse types of binary relations from biomedical literature using deep syntactic patterns. Our experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a level of recall considerably higher than the state of the art, while maintaining reasonable precision. We have then applied PASMED to the whole MEDLINE corpus and extracted more than 137 million semantic relations. The extracted relations provide a quantitative understanding of what kinds of semantic relations are actually described in MEDLINE and can be ultimately extracted by (possibly type-specific) relation extraction systems. Conclusion: PASMED extracts a large number of relations that have previously been missed by existing text mining systems. The entire collection of the relations extracted from MEDLINE is publicly available in machine-readable form, so that it can serve as a potential knowledge base for high-level text-mining applications.

222787;"Document grouping with concept based discriminative analysis and feature partition";5;"Kajapriya, S. and Shankar, K.N.V.";"Clustering is one of the most important techniques in machine learning and data mining responsibilities. Similar documents are grouped by performing clustering techniques. Similarity measure is used to determine transaction associations. Hierarchical clustering method produces tree structured results. Partition based clustering model produces the results in grid format. Text documents are formless data values with high dimensional attributes. Document clustering group the unlabeled text documents into meaningful clusters. Traditionally clustering methods need cluster count (K) before the document grouping process. Clustering accuracy decreases drastically with reference to the unsuitable cluster count. Document word features are automatically partitioned into two groups discriminative words and non-discriminative words. But only discriminative words are useful for grouping documents. The contribution of nondiscriminative words confuses the clustering process and leads to poor cluster solutions. The variational inference algorithm is used to infer the document collection structure and partition of document words at the same time. Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model is used to partition documents. DPM clustering model utilizes both the data likelihood and the clustering property of the Dirichlet Process (DP). Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Feature Partition (DPMFP) is used to discover the latent cluster structure based on the DPM model. DPMFP clustering model is performed without requiring the no. of clusters as input. The Discriminative word identification process is enhanced with the labeled document analysis mechanism. The concept relationships are analyzed with Ontology support. Semantic weight analysis is used for the document similarity measure. This method increases the scalability with the support of labels and concept relations for dimensionality cutback process.

222792;"Completing keyword patent search with semantic patent search: introducing a semiautomatic iterative method for patent near search based on semantic similarities";5;"Moeller, A. and Moehrle, M.G.";"Patent search is a substantial basis for many operational questions and scientometric evaluations. We consider it as a sequence of distinct stages. The â€œpatent wide searchâ€� involves a definition of system boundaries by means of classifications and a keyword search producing a patent set with a high recall level (see Schmitz in Patentinformetrie: Analyse und Verdichtung von technischen Schutzrechtsinformationen, DGI, Frankfurt (Main), 2010 with an overview of searchable patent meta data). In this set of patents a â€œpatent near searchâ€� takes place, producing a patent set with high(er) precision. Hence, the question arises how the researcher has to operate within this patent set to efficiently identify patents that contain paraphrased descriptions of the sought inventive elements in contextual information and whether this produces different results compared to a conventional search. We present a semiautomatic iterative method for the identification of such patents, based on semantic similarity. In order to test our method we generate an initial dataset in the course of a patent wide search. This dataset is then analyzed by means of the semiautomatic iterative method as well as by an alternative method emulating the conventional process of keyword refinement. It thus becomes obvious that both methods have their particular â€œraison dâ€™Ãªtreâ€�, and that the semiautomatic iterative method seems to be able to support a conventional patent search very effectively.

Discovering such knowledge in a robust way from arbitrary text data is a significant challenge in big text data mining. In this paper, we propose a novel general probabilistic approach based on random walks on word adjacency graphs to systematically mine two fundamental and complementary lexical relations, i.e., paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words from arbitrary text data. We show that representing text data as an adjacency graph opens up many opportunities to define interesting random walks for mining lexical relation patterns, and propose specific random walk algorithms for mining paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations. Evaluation results on multiple corpora show that the proposed random walk-based algorithms can discover meaningful paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations of words from text data.

222795;"An experimental study of a hybrid entity recognition and linking system";5;"Plu, J. and Rizzo, G. and Troncy, R.";"We present an experimental study of the performance of a hybrid semantic and linguistic system for recognizing and linking entities from formal and informal texts. In the current literature, systems are generally tailored to one or a few types of textual documents (e.g. narrative texts, newswire articles, informal text such as microposts). In contrast, we assess the performance of a hybrid approach that adapts the entity extraction, recognition and linking process to the type of document being analyzed. The hybrid system relies on POS taggers, gazetteers and Twitter user account dereferencing modules to extract entities, NER modules to recognize and type entities and entity popularity, string distance measures and scoring functions to disambiguate entities by ranking potential link candidates.

222798;"BioHCDP: A hybrid constituency-dependency parser for biological NLP information extraction";5;"Taha, K. and Al Zaabi, M.";"One of the key goals of biological Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the automatic information extraction from biomedical publications. Most current constituency and dependency parsers overlook the semantic relationships between the constituents comprising a sentence and may not be well suited for capturing complex long-distance dependencies. We propose in this paper a hybrid constituency-dependency parser for biological NLP information extraction called BioHCDP. BioHCDP aims at enhancing the state of the art of biological text mining by applying novel linguistic computational techniques that overcome the limitations of current constituency and dependency parsers outlined above, as follows: (1) it determines the semantic relationship between each pair of constituents in a sentence using novel semantic rules, and (2) it applies semantic relationship extraction models that represent the relationships of different patterns of usage in different contexts. BioHCDP can be used to extract various classes of data from biological texts, including protein function assignments, genetic networks, and protein-protein interactions. We compared BioHCDP experimentally with three systems. Results showed marked improvement.

In our setting the concepts are associated with textual fragments, such as labels, descriptions, and links to other relevant concepts. The main task to be solved is the definition of a similarity measure between the single text of the query and the set of texts associated with an ontology concept. We experimentally study this problem on a particular scenario with a socio-pedagogic domain ontology and Italian language texts. We investigate how the basic cosine similarity measure on the bag-of-words text representations can be improved in three distinct ways by (i) taking into account the context of the ontology nodes, (ii) using the linear combination of various measures, and (iii) exploiting semantic resources.

222802;"Distributed document representation for document classification";5;"Li, R.a  and Shindo, H.b ";"The distributed vector representations learned from the deep learning framework have shown its great power in capturing the semantic meaning of words, phrases and sentences, from which multiple NLP applications have benefited. As words combine to form the meaning of sentences, so do sentences combine to form the meaning of documents, the idea of representing each document with a dense distributed representation holds promise. In this paper, we propose a supervised framework (Compound RNN) for document classification based on document-level distributed representations learned from deep learning architecture. Our framework first obtains the distributed representation at sentence-level by operating on the parse tree structure from recursive neural network, and then obtains the document presentation-level by convoluting the sentence vectors from a recurrent neural network. Our framework (Compound RNN) outperforms existing document representations such as bag-of-words, LDA in multiple text classification/regression tasks.

222803;"Semantic views of homogeneous unstructured data";5;"Adrian, W.T.a  b  and Leone, N.a  and Manna, M.a ";"Homogeneous unstructured data (HUD) are collections of unstructured documents that share common properties, such as similar layout, common file format, or common domain of values. Building on such properties, it would be desirable to automatically process HUD to access the main information through a semantic layer â€“ typically an ontology â€“ called semantic view. Hence, we propose an ontology-based approach for extracting semantically rich information from HUD, by integrating and extending recent technologies and results from the fields of classical information extraction, table recognition, ontologies, text annotation, and logic programming. Moreover, we design and implement a system, named KnowRex, that has been successfully applied to curriculum vitae in the Europass style to offer a semantic view of them, and be able, for example, to select those which exhibit required skills.

222805;"Applying the semantic graph approach to automatic essay scoring";5;"Lo, C.S. and Au, O. and Tong, B.K.B.";"Frequent quizzes are used to motivate students to study throughout the academic term instead of waiting until just before the examination. Teachers have been relying on the use of multiple-choice questions to reduce their grading effort. We have developed a tool that grades answers of essay questions automatically. The tool should be a welcome addition to a teacherâ€™s arsenal for quiz preparation. The teacher will provide the model answer of an essay question. Incorporating some heuristics into the Stanford Parser, our tool recognizes the parts of speech of each word and creates a parse tree from each sentence. It builds a semantic graph from the sentences in the model answer. The graph uses nodes to represent words and phrases. A directed arc connects two nodes to represent a relation. Currently, four types of arcs are used: attribute, possession, classification and action. In the same way, our tool determines the semantic graph of the student answer. Our tool compares the graph of the model answer with the graph of the student answer. It calculates a score to reflect their similarity. The relative weights of nodes and arcs are adjustable. WordNet helps us to identify synonyms so that the two answers need not be using the same wording to be considered similar. Our tool has some limitations. First, our semantic graph cannot handle timing sequences, for example, â€œevent A happens before event Bâ€�. Second, our graph cannot handle conditional knowledge like â€œif X, then Yâ€�. In the future, we may be able to introduce new arc types to address these limitations. Our prototype is not yet ready to replace the grading performed by teachers in formal assessment. But it may be useful to allow students to check their understanding during their self-study.

Social network applications create opportunities to establish interaction among people leading to mutual learning and sharing of valuable knowledge, such as chat, comments, and discussion boards. Data in social networking websites is inherently unstructured and fuzzy in nature. In everyday life conversations, people do not care about the spellings and accurate grammatical construction of a sentence that may lead to different types of ambiguities, such as lexical, syntactic, and semantic. Therefore, analyzing and extracting information patterns from such data sets are more complex. Several surveys have been conducted to analyze different methods for the information extraction. Most of the surveys emphasized on the application of different text mining techniques for unstructured data sets reside in the form of text documents, but do not specifically target the data sets in social networking website. This survey attempts to provide a thorough understanding of different text mining techniques as well as the application of these techniques in the social networking websites.

Different semantic, lexical and vector based similarity metrics are used as features for different machine learning classifiers to take the entailment decision in this study. We also considered two machine translation evaluation metrics, namely BLEU and METEOR, as similarity metrics for this task. We carried out the experiments on the datasets released in the shared tasks on textual entailment organized in RTE-1, RTE-2, and RTE-3. We experimented with different feature combinations.

As more customers participate in suggesting ideas, companies are likely to acquire more valuable ones. At the same time, however, some fundamental problems occur such as managing and selecting useful ideas from a large number of collected ideas. Semantic web mining techniques allow us to manage a large number of customers ideas effectively, extract meaningful information from the ideas, and provide useful information for idea selection. In order to cope with such problems and enhance the value of co-creation, we propose an ontology-based co-creation enhancing system (OnCES) developed using semantic web mining techniques. To this end, we 1) defined a co-creation idea ontology (CCIO) that includes common concepts related to customers ideas from MyStarbucksIdea.com, their attributes, and relationships between them; 2) transformed the customers ideas into semantic data in RDF format according to the CCIO; 3) conducted text mining to extract new knowledge from the ideas such as keywords, the number of positive words, the number of negative words, and the sentiment score; and 4) built prediction models using keywords and other features such as those about customer and idea in order to predict the adoptability of each idea. The results of text mining and prediction analysis were also added to the semantic data.

Users and products are modeled using vector space models, the representations of which capture important global clues such as individual preferences of users or overall qualities of products.

222820;"Application of a staged learning-based resource allocation network to automatic text categorization";5;"Song, W.a  b  and Chen, P.a  b  and Cheol Park, S.c ";"In this paper, we propose a novel learning classifier which utilizes a staged learning-based resource allocation network (SLRAN) for text categorization. In the light of its learning progress, SLRAN is divided into a preliminary learning phase and a refined learning phase. In the former phase, to reduce the sensitivity corresponding to input data an agglomerate hierarchical k-means method is utilized to create the initial structure of hidden layer. Subsequently, a novelty criterion is put forward to dynamically regulate the hidden layer centers. In the latter phase a least square method is used to enhance the convergence rate of network and further improve its ability for classification. Such staged learning-based approach builds a compact structure which decreases the computational complexity of network and boosts its learning capability. In order to implement SLRAN to text categorization, we utilize a semantic similarity approach which reduces the input scales of neural network and reveals the latent semantics between text features. The benchmark Reuter and 20-newsgroup datasets are tested in our experiments and the extensive experimental results reveal that the dynamic learning process of SLRAN improves its classifying performance in comparison with conventional classifiers, e.g. RAN, BP, RBF neural networks and SVM.

222823;"Arabic document similarity analysis using n-grams and singular value decomposition";5;"Hussein, A.S.";"The computerized methods for document similarity estimation (or plagiarism detection) in natural languages, evolved during the last two decades, have focused on English language in particular and some other languages such as German and Chinese. On the other hand, there are several language-independent methods, but the accuracy of these methods is not satisfactory, especially with morphological and complicated languages such as Arabic. This paper proposes an innovative content-based method for document similarity analysis devoted to Arabic language in order to bridge the existing gap in such software solutions. The proposed method is based on modeling the relation between documents and their n-gram phrases. These phrases are generated from the normalized text, exploiting Arabic morphology analysis and lexical lookup. Resolving possible morphological ambiguity is carried out through applying Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging on the examined documents. Text indexing and stop-words removal are performed, employing a new method based on text morphological analysis. The examined documents TF-IDF model is constructed using Heuristic based pair-wise matching algorithm, considering lexical and syntactic changes. Then, the hidden associations between the unique n-gram phrases and their documents are investigated using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Next, the pairwise document subset and similarity measures are derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) computations. The performance of the proposed method was confirmed through experiments with various data sets, exhibiting promising capabilities in estimating literal and some types of intelligent similarities. Finally, the results of the proposed method was compared to that of Plagiarism-Checker-X, and the proposed method outperformed Plagiarism-Checker-X, especially for the intelligent similarity cases with syntactic changes.

222824;"Computing semantic similarity for vietnamese concepts using wikipedia";5;"Nguyen, H.T.";"Evaluating semantic similarity between concepts is a very common component in many applications dealing with textual data such as information extraction, information retrieval, natural language processing, or knowledge acquisition. This paper presents an approach to assess semantic similarity between Vietnamese concepts using Vietnamese Wikipedia. Firstly, the Vietnamese Wikipediaâ€™ structure is exploited to derive a Vietnamese ontology. Next, based on the obtained ontology, we employ similarity measures in literature to evaluate the semantic similarity between Vietnamese concepts. Then we conduct an experiment providing 30 Vietnamese concept pairs to 18 human subjects to assess similarity of these pairs. Finally, we use Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient to estimate the correlation between human judgments and the results of similarity measures employed. The experiment results show that our system achieves quite good performance and that similarity measures between Vietnamese concepts are potential in enhancing the performance of applications dealing with textual data.

222825;"Modeling social media content with word vectors for recommendation";5;"Ding, Y. and Jiang, J.";"In social media, recommender systems are becoming more and more important. Different techniques have been designed for recommendations under various scenarios, but many of them do not use user-generated content, which potentially reflects usersâ€™ opinions and interests. Although a few studies have tried to combine user-generated content with rating or adoption data, they mostly reply on lexical similarity to calculate textual similarity. However, in social media, a diverse range of words is used. This renders the traditional ways of calculating textual similarity ineffective. In this work, we apply vector representation of words to measure the semantic similarity between text. We design a model that seamlessly integrates word vectors into a joint model of user feedback and text content. Extensive experiments on datasets from various domains prove that our model is effective in both recommendation and topic discovery in social media.

222828;"In defense of word embedding for generic text representation";5;"Lev, G. and Klein, B. and Wolf, L.";"Statistical methods have shown a remarkable ability to capture semantics. The word2vec method is a frequently cited method for capturing meaningful semantic relations between words from a large text corpus. It has the advantage of not requiring any tagging while training. The prevailing view is, however, that it lacks the ability to capture semantics of word sequences and is virtually useless for most purposes, unless combined with heavy machinery. This paper challenges that view, by showing that by augmenting the word2vec representation with one of a few pooling techniques, results are obtained surpassing or comparable with the best literature algorithms. This improved performance is justified by theory and verified by extensive experiments on well studied NLP benchmarks (This work is inspired by [10]).

222831;"Web person disambiguation using hierarchical co-reference model";5;"Xu, J. and Lu, Q. and Li, M. and Li, W.";"As one of the entity disambiguation tasks, Web Person Disambiguation (WPD) identifies different persons with the same name by grouping search results for different persons into different clusters. Most of current research works use clustering methods to conduct WPD. These approaches require the tuning of thresholds that are biased towards training data and may not work well for different datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by using pairwise co-reference modeling for WPD without the need to do threshold tuning. Because person names are named entities, disambiguation of person names can use semantic measures using the so called co-reference resolution criterion across different documents. The algorithm first forms a forest with person names as observable leaf nodes. It then stochastically tries to form an entity hierarchy by merging names into a sub-tree as a latent entity group if they have co-referential relationship across documents. As the joining/partition of nodes is based on co-reference-based comparative values, our method is independent of training data, and thus parameter tuning is not required. Experiments show that this semantic based method has achieved comparable performance with the top two state-of-the-art systems without using any training data. The stochastic approach also makes our algorithm to exhibit near linear processing time much more efficient than HAC based clustering method. Because our model allows a small number of upper-level entity nodes to summarize a large number of name mentions, the model has much higher semantic representation power and it is much more scalable over large collections of name mentions compared to HAC based algorithms.

This problem has been traditionally addressed through the textual query. In other words, information retrieval techniques will be exploited based on the textual similarity between queries and textual representation of software artifacts, which is generated by collecting words from comments, identifiers, and descriptions of programs. However, in addition to these semantic information, there are rich information embedded in source codes themselves. These source codes, if analyzed properly, can be a rich source for enhancing the efforts of software artifact retrieval. To this end, in this paper, we develop a feature extraction method on source codes. Specifically, this method can capture both the inherent information in the source codes and the semantic information hidden in the comments, descriptions, and identifiers of the source codes. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous metric learning approach, which allows to integrate code features and text features into the same latent semantic space. This, in turn, can help to measure the artifact similarity by exploiting the joint power of both code and text features. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data show that the proposed method can help to improve the performances of software artifact retrieval with a significant margin.

222846;"Boosting explicit semantic analysis by clustering paragraph vectors of Wikipedia articles";5;"Zheng, H.-T. and Wu, W.";"Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is an effective method that utilizesWikipedia entries (articles) to represent text and compute semantic relatedness (SR) for text pairs. Analogous to ordinary web search techniques, ESA also suffers from the redundancy issues due to the ongoing expansion of the amount of Wikipedia entries. Entries redundancy could lead to biased representation that lay particular emphasis on semantics from a large number of similar entries. On the other hand, original ESA for SR has a weak point that it does not consider the correlations or similarities between the Wikipedia articles of the text representations. To tackle these problems, We develop a novel method to cluster the redundant or similar entries by similarity measurement based on Paragraph Vector (PV), a neural network language model. Results of experiments on four datasets show that our framework could gain better performance in relatedness accuracy against ESA.

222847;"Semantic HMC: Ontology-described hierarchy maintenance in big data context";5;"Peixoto, R.a  b  and Cruz, C.b  and Silva, N.a ";"One of the biggest challenges in Big Data is the exploitation of Value from large volumes of data that are constantly changing. To exploit value, one must focus on extracting knowledge from these Big Data sources. To extract knowledge and value from unstructured text we propose using a Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification process called Semantic HMC that uses ontologies to describe the predictive model including the label hierarchy and the classification rules.

With the rapid rise in use and popularity of social media, people tend to share opinions and observations for almost any subject or event in their everyday life. Consequently, microblogging websites have become a rich data source for user-generated information. The leading opportunity is to take advantage of the wisdom of the crowd and to benefit from collective intelligence in any applicable domain. Towards this direction, we focus on the problem of mining and extracting knowledge from unstructured textual content, for the atmospheric environment domain and its effect to quality of life. As the main contribution, we propose a combined methodology of unsupervised learning methods for analyzing posts from Twitter and clustering textual data into concepts with semantically similar context. By applying Self-Organizing Maps and k-means clustering, we identify possible inter-relationships and patterns of words used in tweets that can form upper concepts of atmospheric and health related topics of discussion. We achieve to group together tweets, from more generic to more specific description levels of their content, according to the selected number of clusters. Strong clusters with significant semantic relatedness among their content are revealed, and hidden relations between concepts and their related semantics are acquired. The results highlight the potential use of social media text streams as a highly-valued supplement source of environmental information and situation awareness.

The estimation of the semantic similarity between words provides a valuable method to enable the understanding of texts. In the field of biomedical domains, using Ontologies have been very effective due to their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we aim to cluster and classify medical thesis data to better discover the commonalities between theses data and hence, improve the accuracy of the similarity estimation which in return improves the scientific research sector. Experimental evaluations using 4,878 theses data set in the medical sector at Cairo University indicate that the proposed approach yields results that correlate more closely with human assessments than other by using the standard ontology (MeSH). Two different algorithms were used; the first is Lexical similarity and then applying K-means clustering and the second is fuzzy Euclidean distance clustering algorithm after using MeSH ontology on medical theses data for better categorization of the keywords within the data.

Results demonstrate that PBA can effectively detect reader-emotions by exploiting the syntactic structures and semantic associations in the context, thus outperforming wellknown statistical text classification methods and the state-of-the-art reader-emotion classification method. Moreover, writers are able to create more emotional resonance in articles under the assistance of the generated emotion templates.

222855;"Parallelization of a graph-cut based algorithm for hierarchical clustering of web documents";5;"Seshadri, K. and Shalinie, S.M.";"Summary: We propose a parallelization scheme for an existing algorithm for constructing a web-directory, that contains categories of web documents organized hierarchically. The clustering algorithm automatically infers the number of clusters using a quality function based on graph cuts. A parallel implementation of the algorithm has been developed to run on a cluster of multi-core processors interconnected by an intranet. The effect of the well-known Latent Semantic Indexing on the performance of the clustering algorithm is also considered. The parallelized graph-cut based clustering algorithm achieves an F-measure in the range [0.69,0.91] for the generated leaf-level clusters while yielding a precision-recall performance in the range [0.66,0.84] for the entire hierarchy of the generated clusters. As measured via empirical observations, the parallel algorithm achieves an average speedup of 7.38 over its sequential variant, at the same time yielding a better clustering performance than the sequential algorithm in terms of F-measure.

Manual curation of these data is a demanding task, and latest strategies use computerized solutions to aid in the analysis, extraction and storage of relevant concepts and their respective attributes and relationships. The outcome of these complex document curation workflows provides valuable insights into the overwhelming amount of biomedical information being produced. Yet, the majority of automated and interactive annotation tools are not open, limiting access to knowledge and reducing the potential scope of the manually curated information.

In the first stage, a novel CCD method is proposed to select the most effective features for text classification, which is more effective than the traditional feature selection method. In the second stage, document representation requires a high dimensionality of the feature space and does not take into account the semantic relation between features, which leads to a poor categorization accuracy. So LSI method is proposed to solve these problems by using statistically derived conceptual indices to replace the individual terms which can discover the important correlative relationship between features and reduce the feature space dimension. Firstly, each feature in our algorithm is ranked depending on their importance of classification using CCD method. Secondly, we construct a new semantic space based on LSI method among features. The experimental results have proved that our method can reduce effectively the dimension of text vector and improve the performance of text categorization.

The downside of this success is that users are increasingly overloaded by the many thousands of deals offered each day by dozens of deal providers and aggregators. The challenge is thus offering the right deals to the right users i.e., the relevance ranking of deals. This is the problem we address in our paper. Exploiting the characteristics of deals data, we propose a combination of a term- and a concept-based retrieval model that closes the semantic gap between queries and documents expanding both of them with category information.

222874;"Tweet timeline generation via graph-based dynamic greedy clustering";5;"Fan, F.a  and Qiang, R.a  and Lv, C.a  and Zhao, W.X.b  and Yang, J.a ";"When searching a query in the microblogging, a user would typically receive an archive of tweets as part of a retrospective piece on the impact of social media. For ease of understanding the retrieved tweets, it is useful to produce a summarized timeline about a given topic. However, tweet timeline generation is quite challenging due to the noisy and temporal characteristics of microblogs. In this paper, we propose a graph-based dynamic greedy clustering approach, which considers the coverage, relevance and novelty of the tweet timeline. First, tweet embedding representation is learned in order to construct the tweet semantic graph. Based on the graph, we estimate the coverage of timeline according to the graph connectivity. Furthermore, we integrate a noise tweet elimination component to remove noisy tweets with the lexical and semantic features based on relevance and novelty. Experimental results on public Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Twitter corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

222880;"A general framework for text document classification using SEMCON and ACVSR";5;"Kastrati, Z. and Imran, A.S. and Yayilgan, S.Y.";"The text document classification employs either text based approach or semantic based approach to index and retrieve text documents. The former uses keywords and therefore provides limited capabilities to capture and exploit the conceptualization involved in user information needs and content meanings. The latter aims to solve these limitations using content meanings, rather than keywords. More formally, the semantic based approach uses the domain ontology to exploit the content meanings of a particular domain. This approach however has some drawbacks. It lacks enrichment of ontology concepts with new lexical resources and evaluation of the importance indicated by weights of those concepts. Therefore to address these issues, this paper proposes a new ontology based text document classification framework. The proposed framework incorporates a newly developed objective metric called SEMCON to enrich the domain ontology with new concepts by combining contextual as well as semantic information of a term within a text document. The framework also introduces a new approach to automatically estimate the importance of ontology concepts which is indicated by the weights of these concepts, and to enhance the concept vector space model using automatically estimated weights.

It represents a text as a bag of words without regard to word order and relationship. We propose a new text classification approach that is based on a more efficient text representation than the Bag-of-words model. Our approach employs automatic relation extraction via statistical co-occurrence of words in a given text collection. We extract relations in the form of word-word proximity matrix and then use the matrix elements as correction factors for the Bag-of-words text representation. Thereby we obtain a new text representation model enriched by semantic relations. Combining this model with Support Vector Machine classifier we perform a series of experiments on text classification. The experimental results prove that our approach enhances accuracy of text classification compared to the Bag-of-words approach.

New words (terms/concepts) may be added as a result of scientific discoveries or socio-cultural influences, while other words are ""forgotten"" or are assigned alternative meanings. These changes in a vocabulary usually characterize important shifts in the environment or the domain they are used in. For experts there is an evident connection between a new concept and some of the existing ones, but for regular people these relations remain hidden and need to be identified. In particular, in the medical domain new terms appear as a result of new discoveries and it becomes an important challenge to establish the connections between different concepts. Moreover, it is important to detect if such a relation even exists. In this paper, we present a graph-based approach to identify the semantic path (which is a chain of semantically related words) between the concepts that appeared in the bio-medicine publications available in the Pub Med corpus over a time period of 20 years.

In this study, the use of text classifiers for automatically classifying documents according to their corresponding group of semantically related documents is evaluated. Supporting documents of claims were used as representations of document discourses. The evaluation was performed under varying general conditions (such as dimensionality level and weighting method) to assess the effect of such conditions on performance, and varying classifier-specific parameters. The highest performance in terms of classification accuracy was achieved by a Rocchio classifier and a kNN classifier with the application of dimensionality reduction and using the tf-idf weighting method. A combined classifier approach was also evaluated in which the classification outcome is based on a majority vote strategy between the outcomes of three different classifiers. The evaluation demonstrated that classification accuracy of standard text classifiers can be refined by applying an appropriate level of dimensionality reduction to the training and testing sets and by combining the results of several classifiers. Accordingly, such application enables effective utilization of standard text classifiers for automatic organization of project documents based on text content.

222896;"Computational irony: A survey and new perspectives";5;"Wallace, B.C.";"Irony is a fundamental rhetorical device. It is a uniquely human mode of communication, curious in that the speaker says something other than what he or she intends. Recently, computationally detecting irony has attracted attention from the natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) communities. While some progress has been made toward this end, I argue that current machine learning methods rely too heavily on shallow, unstructured, syntactic modeling of text to consistently discern ironic intent. Irony detection is an interesting machine learning problem because, in contrast to most text classification tasks, it requires a semantics that cannot be inferred directly from word counts over documents alone. To support this position, I survey the large body of existing philosophical/literary work investigating ironic communication. I then survey more recent computational efforts to operationalize irony detection in the fields of NLP and ML. I identify the disparities of the latter with respect to the former. Specifically, I highlight a major conceptual problem in all existing computational models of irony: none maintain an explicit model of the speaker/environment. I argue that without such an internal model of the speaker, irony detection is hopeless, as this model is necessary to represent expectations, which play a key role in ironic communication. I sketch possible means of embedding such models into computational approaches to irony detection.

222897;"Graph-based approach for cross domain text linking";5;"Hu, Y. and Nie, T. and Shen, D. and Kou, Y.";"Comprehensive analysis of multi-domain texts has generated an important effect on text mining. Although the objects described by these multi-domain texts belong to different fields, they sometimes are overlapped partially; and linking these texts fragments which are overlapped or complementary is a necessary step for many tasks, such as entity resolution, information retrieval and text clustering. Previous works for computing text similarity mainly focus on string-based, corpus-based and knowledge-based approaches. However cross-domain texts exhibit very special features compared to texts in the same domain: (1) entity ambiguity, texts from different domains may contain various references to the same entity; (2) content skewness, cross domain texts are overlapped partially. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained approach based on text graph for evaluating the semantic similarity of cross-domain texts to link the similar parts. The experiment results show that our approach gives an effective solution to discover the semantic relationship between cross domain text fragments.

222901;"Semantic clustering-based cross-domain recommendation";5;"Kumar, A.a  and Kumar, N.a  and Hussain, M.a  and Chaudhury, S.b  and Agarwal, S.b ";"Cross-domain recommendation systems exploit tags, textual descriptions or ratings available for items in one domain to recommend items in multiple domains. Handling unstructured/ unannotated item information is, however, a challenge. Topic modeling offer a popular method for deducing structure in such data corpora. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a common latent semantic space, spanning multiple domains, using topic modeling of semantic clustered vocabularies of distinct domains. The intuition here is to use explicitly-determined semantic relationships between non-identical, but possibly semantically equivalent, words in multiple domain vocabularies, in order to capture relationships across information obtained in distinct domains. The popular WordNet based ontology is used to measure semantic relatedness between textual words. The experimental results shows that there is a marked improvement in the precision of predicting user preferences for items in one domain when given the preferences in another domain.

222910;"Emotion recognition from text based on automatically generated rules";5;"Shaheen, S.a  and El-Hajj, W.a  and Hajj, H.b  and Elbassuoni, S.a ";"With the growth of the Internet community, textual data has proven to be the main tool of communication in human-machine and human-human interaction. This communication is constantly evolving towards the goal of making it as human and real as possible. One way of humanizing such interaction is to provide a framework that can recognize the emotions present in the communication or the emotions of the involved users in order to enrich user experience. For example, by providing insights to users for personal preferences and automated recommendations based on their emotional state. In this work, we propose a framework for emotion classification in English sentences where emotions are treated as generalized concepts extracted from the sentences. We start by generating an intermediate emotional data representation of a given input sentence based on its syntactic and semantic structure. We then generalize this representation using various ontologies such as Word Net and Concept Net, which results in an emotion seed that we call an emotion recognition rule (ERR). Finally, we use a suite of classifiers to compare the generated ERR with a set of reference ERRs extracted from a training set in a similar fashion. The used classifiers are k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with handcrafted similarity measure, Point Mutual Information (PMI), and PMI with Information Retrieval (PMI-IR). When applied on different datasets, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the existing state-of- The art machine learning and rule-based classifiers with an average F-Score of 84%.

222912;"Rehabilitation of count-based models for word vector representations";5;"Lebret, R.a  b  and Collobert, R.a ";"Recent works on word representations mostly rely on predictive models. Distributed word representations (aka word embeddings) are trained to optimally predict the contexts in which the corresponding words tend to appear. Such models have succeeded in capturing word similarities as well as semantic and syntactic regularities. Instead, we aim at reviving interest in a model based on counts. We present a systematic study of the use of the Hellinger distance to extract semantic representations from the word co-occurrence statistics of large text corpora. We show that this distance gives good performance on word similarity and analogy tasks, with a proper type and size of context, and a dimensionality reduction based on a stochastic low-rank approximation. Besides being both simple and intuitive, this method also provides an encoding function which can be used to infer unseen words or phrases. This becomes a clear advantage compared to predictive models which must train these new words.

In this paper we investigate the automatic detection of Tweets that advertise satirical news in English, Spanish and Italian. To this purpose we present a system that models Tweets from different languages by a set of language independent features that describe lexical, semantic and usage-related properties of the words of each Tweet. We approach the satire identification problem as binary classification of Tweets as satirical or not satirical messages. We test the performance of our system by performing experiments of both monolingual and cross-language classifications, evaluating the satire detection effectiveness of our features.

222920;"Exploring concept graphs for biomedical literature mining";5;"Song, M.";"Full-text publications in an electronic form become more prevalent than ever before. It is a difficult challenge to extract concepts from unstructured document collections data because different concepts and their relationships are buried in them and ample term variations make the challenge compound. Extracted concepts are useful instruments of managing and searching large document collections and play a pivotal role in indexing electronic documents and building digital libraries. In this paper we explore a biomedical concept extraction technique based on a ranking algorithm of concept graphs. The proposed technique comprises two major steps: the first step is to represent documents with graphs whose nodes and edges are created by Named Entity Recognition and UMLS Semantic Network. The second step is rank concepts with relative importance algorithms. We evaluate our technique with a set of biomedical full-texts and compare it to various different key-phrase extraction and graph ranking techniques. The experimental results show that our technique achieves the best performance over other compared algorithms. We further take a close look at the properties of the network to examine how concepts are related to each other and what concept plays a dominant role in the network. To this end, we build the network with 526 full-text articles published in PubMed Central and measure the significance of nodes by centrality.

The documents comparison using the conventional clustering techniques is based on the surface similarities of words or extracted morphemes. This leads to non-semantic clusters usually. In this paper, Farsi, also known as Persian, has been taken into account with regards to the fact that the amount of electronic Farsi texts are growing rapidly. The documents are enriched by using semantic relationships - synonymy, hypernymy and hyponymy-extracted from FarsNet lexical ontology. A WSD procedure is proposed to decrease uncertainty.

222959;"Wikipedia-Based Semantic Similarity Measurements for Noisy Short Texts Using Extended Naive Bayes";5;"Shirakawa, M.a  and Nakayama, K.b  and Hara, T.a  and Nishio, S.a ";"This paper proposes a Wikipedia-based semantic similarity measurement method that is intended for real-world noisy short texts. Our method is a kind of explicit semantic analysis (ESA), which adds a bag of Wikipedia entities (Wikipedia pages) to a text as its semantic representation and uses the vector of entities for computing the semantic similarity. Adding related entities to a text, not a single word or phrase, is a challenging practical problem because it usually consists of several subproblems, e.g., key term extraction from texts, related entity finding for each key term, and weight aggregation of related entities. Our proposed method solves this aggregation problem using extended naive Bayes, a probabilistic weighting mechanism based on the Bayes theorem. Our method is effective especially when the short text is semantically noisy, i.e., they contain some meaningless or misleading terms for estimating their main topic. Experimental results on Twitter message and Web snippet clustering revealed that our method outperformed ESA for noisy short texts. We also found that reducing the dimension of the vector to representative Wikipedia entities scarcely affected the performance while decreasing the vector size and hence the storage space and the processing time of computing the cosine similarity.

222960;"User modeling with neural network for review rating prediction";5;"Tang, D.a  and Qin, B.a  and Liu, T.a  and Yang, Y.b ";"We present a neural network method for review rating prediction in this paper. Existing neural network methods for sentiment prediction typically only capture the semantics of texts, but ignore the user who expresses the sentiment. This is not desirable for review rating prediction as each user has an influence on how to interpret the textual content of a review. For example, the same word (e.g. ""good"") might indicate different sentiment strengths when written by different users. We address this issue by developing a new neural network that takes user information into account. The intuition is to factor in user-specific modification to the meaning of a certain word. Specifically, we extend the lexical semantic composition models and introduce a userword composition vector model (UWCVM), which effectively captures how user acts as a function affecting the continuous word representation. We integrate UWCVM into a supervised learning framework for review rating prediction, and conduct experiments on two benchmark review datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In the biomedical text, the text should be in the form of text which can be present in the books, articles, literature abstracts, and so forth.

222970;"Supervised adaptive-transfer PLSA for cross-domain text classification";5;"Zhao, R. and Mao, K.";"Cross-domain learning is a very promising technique to improve classification in the target (testing) domain whose data distributions are very different from the source (training) domain. Many cross-domain text classification methods are built on topic modeling approaches. However, topic model methods are unsupervised in nature without fully utilizing the label information of the source domain. In addition, almost all cross-domain learning approaches utilize the knowledge of source domain in the later stage of the training process, and this limits the knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a model named Supervised Adaptive transfer Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (SAtPLSA) for cross-domain text classification aiming to deal with the above two issues. The proposed model extends the original PLSA to a supervised learning paradigm. By defining the common labeled information from each term across domains, we transfer knowledge in source domain to assist classifying text in target domain. In addition, we adaptively modify the weight value controlling the proportion of the usage of knowledge from source domain in the model learning process. At last, we conducted experiments on nine benchmark datasets in cross domain text classification to compare the performance of our proposed algorithm with two classicalsupervised learning methods and five state-of-art transfer learning approaches. The experimental results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed SAtPLSA algorithm.

Many studies have focused on finding exact term matching to predict sentence similarity. In this paper, we present a method for measuring sematic similarity of sentences based on constructed synonymy graph to avoid considering just exactly matching terms. When we construct graph which has terms as nodes and synonymy relation as edges, we use WordNet and part-of-speech to exploit synonyms. We assume synonym of a synonym is also similar; it takes advantage of the fact friend of a friend is likely to be a friend as well in real-world. With this concept, similarity between words is estimated by exploiting the minimum number of synonym chains between two nodes. The proposed algorithm calculates similarity of two sentences by summing all the similarities between selected words in sentences. Evaluation is conducted on two different data sets, Microsoft Research paraphrase corpus, and Yelp review dataset. Experimental evidences show that 1) the proposed method is more accurate compared to existing sentence similarity measures and 2) using real-world dataset like Yelp reveals that the proposed method has chance to be applied to recommendation.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";17;"2015";"ACM IMCOM 2015 - Proceedings";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84926199814&partnerID=40&md5=c60e0efaa9d6c90b5b217af7f7ada8e2";;;"10.1145/2701126.2701219";;"02/25/2016";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"22/04/16";"2";"N";"Y";"similaridade semantica";"null";"vector space model";"Wordnet";"null";"similaridade de documentos";"null";"null";"Precision, Recall, F-measure";"Yelp";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

However, the solutions found in the literature are unsatisfactory, mainly due to the use of static definitions for noun phrases and the fact that noun phrases per se do not enable an adequate relevance representation since they are expressions that barely repeat. We present an approach to deal with these problems by (i) introducing a process that enables the definition of noun phrases interactively and (ii) considering similar noun phrases as a unique term. A case study compares both approaches, the one proposed in this paper and the other based on BOW.

222984;"Implementation of an algorithm to classify discourse segments from documents for knowledge acquisition";5;"Madhusudanan, N. and Chakrabarti, A. and Gurumoorthy, B.";"The overall objective of this paper is to acquire diagnostic knowledge about aircraft assembly in an automated manner, in order to minimize issues from occurring in new, similar situations. This research uses documents, prepared by experts, as a source of knowledge. The first step of the process of knowledge acquisition is segmentation of relevant sections of documents. From many methods that currently exist for such segmentation and classification, one method, namely â€˜discourse analysisâ€™ is chosen for analyzing documents (with future knowledge considerations in mind). Using discourse analysis, entities from sentences are extracted to identify what is being discussed in a chunk of text. These entities are then compared to a domain knowledge base, such as an ontology, to see how (semantically) close the discussion is to the domain of interest. A method for such segmentation had been previously proposed, and is summarised here. This paper describes the efforts for partial implementation of this method. Computer-based tools are used for this implementation, such as Natural Language Toolkit, Boxer, and Ontologies. The Natural Language Toolkit is used for performing text processing, such as tokenization; Boxer is used for Discourse Analysis; Ontologies are used as a knowledge base for domain related terminologies. The method calculates a semantic score for each sentence against the terms taken from related domain ontologies. If the sentence has terms matching those in the ontology, that sentence is classified as being related to the domain of aircraft assembly. The implementation is then applied on test documents to evaluate its performance.

222987;"Multidimensional analysis model for a document warehouse that includes textual measures";5;"Mendoza, M.a  b  and AlegrÃ­a, E.a  and Maca, M.a  and Cobos, C.a  b  and LeÃ³n, E.c ";"Data warehouses and On-Line Analytical Processing tools, OLAP, together permit a multi-dimensional analysis of structured data information. However, as business systems are increasingly required to handle substantial quantities of unstructured textual information, the need arises for an effective and similar means of analysis. To manage unstructured text data stored in data warehouses, a new multi-dimensional analysis model is proposed that includes textual measures as well as a topic hierarchy. In this model, the textual measures that associate the topics with the text documents are generated by Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis, while the hierarchy is created automatically using a clustering algorithm. Documents are then able to be queried using OLAP tools. The model was evaluated from two viewpoints - query execution time and user satisfaction. Evaluation of execution time was carried out on scientific articles using two query types and user satisfaction (with query time and ease of use) using statistical frequency and multivariate analyses. Encouraging observations included that as the number of documents increases, query time increases as a lineal, rather than exponential tendency. In addition, the model gained an increasing acceptance with use, while the visualization of the model was also well received by users. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

222990;"Link-topic model for biomedical abbreviation disambiguation";5;"Kim, S.a  and Yoon, J.b ";"Introduction: The ambiguity of biomedical abbreviations is one of the challenges in biomedical text mining systems. In particular, the handling of term variants and abbreviations without nearby definitions is a critical issue. In this study, we adopt the concepts of topic of document and word link to disambiguate biomedical abbreviations. Methods: We newly suggest the link topic model inspired by the latent Dirichlet allocation model, in which each document is perceived as a random mixture of topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. Thus, the most probable expansions with respect to abbreviations of a given abstract are determined by word-topic, document-topic, and word-link distributions estimated from a document collection through the link topic model. The model allows two distinct modes of word generation to incorporate semantic dependencies among words, particularly long form words of abbreviations and their sentential co-occurring words; a word can be generated either dependently on the long form of the abbreviation or independently. The semantic dependency between two words is defined as a link and a new random parameter for the link is assigned to each word as well as a topic parameter. Because the link status indicates whether the word constitutes a link with a given specific long form, it has the effect of determining whether a word forms a unigram or a skipping/consecutive bigram with respect to the long form. Furthermore, we place a constraint on the model so that a word has the same topic as a specific long form if it is generated in reference to the long form. Consequently, documents are generated from the two hidden parameters, i.e. topic and link, and the most probable expansion of a specific abbreviation is estimated from the parameters. Results: Our model relaxes the bag-of-words assumption of the standard topic model in which the word order is neglected, and it captures a richer structure of text than does the standard topic model by considering unigrams and semantically associated bigrams simultaneously. The addition of semantic links improves the disambiguation accuracy without removing irrelevant contextual words and reduces the parameter space of massive skipping or consecutive bigrams. The link topic model achieves 98.42% disambiguation accuracy on 73,505 MEDLINE abstracts with respect to 21 three letter abbreviations and their 139 distinct long forms.

222992;"Domain-independent unsupervised text segmentation for data management";5;"Sakahara, M. and Okada, S. and Nitta, K.";"In this study, we have proposed a domain-independent unsupervised text segmentation method, which is applicable to even if unseen single document. This proposed method segments text documents by evaluating similarity between sentences. It is generally difficult to calculate semantic similarity between words that comprise sentences when the domain knowledge is insufficient. This problem influences segmentation accuracy. To address this problem, we use word 2 vec to calculate semantic similarity between words. Using word 2 vec, we embed semantic relationships between words in a vector space by training with large domain-independent corpora. Furthermore, we combine semantic and collocation similarities, i.e., The features between words within a document. The proposed method applies this combined similarity to affinity propagation clustering. Similarity between sentences is defined based on the earth movers distance between the frequencies of the obtained topical clusters. After calculating similarity between sentences, segmentation boundaries are automatically optimized using dynamic programming. The experimental results obtained using two datasets show that the proposed method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art domain-independent approaches and obtains equal performance with state-of-the-art domain-dependent approaches such as those that use topic modeling.

Because of the distinct vocabulary used by consumers to describe the same aspects of a product, it is necessary to group pros and cons to support consumersâ€™ decision making. For this purpose we propose a supervised classification model, consisting of an ensemble classifier that combines a main text classifier (e.g. Naive Bayes) and several string-based classifiers. Furthermore we make use of WordNet as a domain independent ontology to detect semantically related words. Experimental results using pros and cons from five heterogeneous product groups show, that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches to group pros and cons from short texts. We also found that the reusable short comments from our sample follow a power law distribution, that is usually present in social tagging systems.

222995;"A supervised parameter estimation method of LDA";5;"Liu, Z.a  b  c  d  and Meng, D.c  and Wang, W.c  and Zhang, C.d ";"Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) probabilistic topic model is a very effective dimension-reduction tool which can automatically extract latent topics and dedicate to text representation in a lower-dimensional semantic topic space. But the original LDA and its most variants are unsupervised without reference to category label of the documents in the training corpus. And most of them view the terms in vocabulary as equally important, but the weight of each term is different, especially for a skewed corpus in which there are many more samples of some categories than others. As a result, we propose a supervised parameter estimation method based on category and document information which can estimate the parameters of LDA according to term weight. The comparative experiments show that the proposed method is superior for the skewed text classification, which can largely improve the recall and precision of the minority category.

223001;"Extract chinese microblog comment related to topic";5;"Liu, Z. and Du, Y. and Fan, Y.";"MicroPomarketing makes microblog become an important advertisement platform. Some microblog posts usually describe some topics, and have a lot of comments. However, some comments related to the topics carry much market intelligence information, and the others may be useless. So, it is significant to extract these relevant comments. In this paper, we defined the Comment Relevant Score (CRS) for each comment, the CRS of a comment reected the correlation of the comment with the topic. Usually, if the contents of a comment had more semantic similarity with the topic, and the commenter had preference for the topic and higher credibility, this comment had higher CRS, so we proposed the Chinese Shorttext Semantic Similarity Algorithm (CSSSA) to calculate the semantic similarity of microblog comment and topic, and defined the User Topic Preference (UTP) and User Authority Value (UAV) for each commenter. Finally, we designed experiments on TENCENT which was one of the biggest Chinese microblog platforms in China, the results of experiments showed that the proposed way was effective.

223007;"Boosting paraphrase detection through textual similarity metrics with abductive networks";5;"El-Alfy, E.-S.M. and Abdel-Aal, R.E. and Al-Khatib, W.G. and Alvi, F.";"A number of metrics have been proposed in the literature to measure text re-use between pairs of sentences or short passages. These individual metrics fail to reliably detect paraphrasing or semantic equivalence between sentences, due to the subjectivity and complexity of the task, even for human beings. This paper analyzes a set of five simple but weak lexical metrics for measuring textual similarity and presents a novel paraphrase detector with improved accuracy based on abductive machine learning. The objective here is 2-fold. First, the performance of each individual metric is boosted through the abductive learning paradigm. Second, we investigate the use of decision-level and feature-level information fusion via abductive networks to obtain a more reliable composite metric for additional performance enhancement. Several experiments were conducted using two benchmark corpora and the optimal abductive models were compared with other approaches. Results demonstrate that applying abductive learning has significantly improved the results of individual metrics and further improvement was achieved through fusion. Moreover, building simple models of polynomial functional elements that identify and integrate the smallest subset of relevant metrics yielded better results than those obtained from the support vector machine classifiers utilizing the same datasets and considered metrics. The results were also comparable to the best result reported in the literature even with larger number of more powerful features and/or using more computationally intensive techniques.

223009;"Portable automatic text classification for adverse drug reaction detection via multi-corpus training";5;"Sarker, A. and Gonzalez, G.";"Objective: Automatic detection of adverse drug reaction (ADR) mentions from text has recently received significant interest in pharmacovigilance research. Current research focuses on various sources of text-based information, including social media-where enormous amounts of user posted data is available, which have the potential for use in pharmacovigilance if collected and filtered accurately. The aims of this study are: (i) to explore natural language processing (NLP) approaches for generating useful features from text, and utilizing them in optimized machine learning algorithms for automatic classification of ADR assertive text segments; (ii) to present two data sets that we prepared for the task of ADR detection from user posted internet data; and (iii) to investigate if combining training data from distinct corpora can improve automatic classification accuracies. Methods: One of our three data sets contains annotated sentences from clinical reports, and the two other data sets, built in-house, consist of annotated posts from social media. Our text classification approach relies on generating a large set of features, representing semantic properties (. e.g., sentiment, polarity, and topic), from short text nuggets. Importantly, using our expanded feature sets, we combine training data from different corpora in attempts to boost classification accuracies. Results: Our feature-rich classification approach performs significantly better than previously published approaches with ADR class F-scores of 0.812 (previously reported best: 0.770), 0.538 and 0.678 for the three data sets. Combining training data from multiple compatible corpora further improves the ADR F-scores for the in-house data sets to 0.597 (improvement of 5.9 units) and 0.704 (improvement of 2.6 units) respectively. Conclusions: Our research results indicate that using advanced NLP techniques for generating information rich features from text can significantly improve classification accuracies over existing benchmarks. Our experiments illustrate the benefits of incorporating various semantic features such as topics, concepts, sentiments, and polarities. Finally, we show that integration of information from compatible corpora can significantly improve classification performance. This form of multi-corpus training may be particularly useful in cases where data sets are heavily imbalanced (. e.g., social media data), and may reduce the time and costs associated with the annotation of data in the future.

223014;"A practical guide to text mining with topic extraction";5;"Karl, A. and Wisnowski, J. and Rushing, W.H.";"Text analytics continue to proliferate as mass volumes of unstructured but highly useful data are generated at unbounded rates. Vector space models for text data-in which documents are represented by rows and words by columns-provide a translation of this unstructured data into a format that may be analyzed with statistical and machine learning techniques. This approach gives excellent results in revealing common themes, clustering documents, clustering words, and in translating unstructured text fields (such as an open-ended survey response) to usable input variables for predictive modeling. After discussing the collection and processing of text, we explore properties and transformations of the document-term matrix (DTM). We show how the singular value decomposition may be used to drastically reduce the size of the document space while also setting the stage for automatic topic extraction, courtesy of the varimax rotation. This latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach produces factors that are compatible with graphical exploration and advanced analytics. We also explore Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic analysis.

223015;"Improving farm management optimization: Application of text data analysis and semantic networks";5;"Liao, W.-T.a  and Rodriguez, L.F.a  and Diesner, J.b  and Lin, T.a ";"Farm management optimization models have been developed to support decision making for farming activities including planting, harvesting, handling, drying and storage. However, key decisions for maximizing farming output, timing of planting and other culture tasks, are affected by spatiotemporal changes of weather- related and other spatiotemporal, conditions. Using near real-time information describing actual farming decisions related to the timing of farming events across different regions can make the outputs of farm management optimization models more accurate. This study aims to develop analytical tools to extract near real-time information for identifying actual timing of crop planting and harvesting schedules from publicly available databases. Text mining is applied to identify planting and harvesting schedules for different crops in various regions. The spatiotemporal patterns of farming activities are also analyzed by comparing annual farming schedules across different regions. In order to support the reasoning behind scheduling of culture tasks, semantic networks representing relationships between concepts are constructed for gaining a qualitative understanding of factors contributing towards key agricultural decisions. Network analysis and visualization help characterize semantic networks assisting to highlight important information regarding farming activities.

223016;"An application of latent semantic analysis for text categorization";5;"Kou, G.a  and Peng, Y.b ";"It is a challenge task to discover major topics from text, which provide a better understanding of the whole corpus and can be regarded as a text categorization problem. The goal of this paper is to apply latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach to extract common factors that representing concepts hidden in a large group of text. LSA involves three steps: the first step is to set up a term-document matrix; the second step is to transform the term frequencies into a term-document matrix using various weighting schemes; the third step performs singular value decomposition (SVD) on the matrix to reduce the dimensionality. The reduced-order SVD is the best k-dimensional approximation to the original matrix. The experiment uses more than fifteen hundreds research paper abstracts from a specific field. Because different factor solutions of the LSA suggest different levels of aggregation, this work examines thirteen solutions in the experiment. The results show that LSA is able to identify not only principle categories, but also major themes contained in the text.

223018;"A discriminative and semantic feature selection method for text categorization";5;"Zong, W.a  and Wu, F.a  and Chu, L.-K.b  and Sculli, D.b ";"Abstract Text categorization is an important and critical task in the current era of high volume data storage and handling. Feature selection is obviously one of the most important steps in text categorization. Traditional feature selection methods tend to only consider the correlation between features and categories, and have in the main ignored the semantic similarity between features and documents. To further explore this issue, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method that first selects features in documents with discriminative power and then computes the semantic similarity between features and documents. The proposed feature selection method is tested using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier upon two published datasets, viz. Reuters-21578 and 20-Newsgroups. The experimental results show that the proposed feature selection method generally outperforms the traditional feature selection methods for text categorization for both published datasets.

To ease data analysis and data evaluations across different types of IT benchmarking approaches a semantic representation of this information is crucial. Thus, the identification of conceptual (semantical) similarities is the first step in the development of an integrative data management in this domain. As an ontology is a specification of such a conceptualization an association of terms, relations between terms and related instances must be developed. Building on previous research we present an approach for an automated term extraction by the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Terms are automatically extracted out of existing IT benchmarking documents leading to a domain specific dictionary. These extracted terms are representative for each document and describe the purpose and content of each file and server as a basis for the ontology development process in the domain of IT benchmarking.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";20;"2015";"ICEIS 2015 - 17th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, Proceedings";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84939516755&partnerID=40&md5=c3f688d361abb3ec7836bfe758b575ed";"1";"360-366";;;"02/25/2016";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"22/04/16";"2";"N";"Y";"classificacao semantica";"topicos";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"accuracy, Recall, Precision";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

On the one hand, the study of occurrences (Principal Component Analysis, Topic Models, Self-Organizing Maps, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis) allows a wide scope of tools to extract and display information from big data. On the other hand, the study of co-occurrences (words belonging to a sentence, a paragraph) allows to keep track of the structure of each text, but is more tedious to handle and often leads to messy visualizations. Here we use the SOM algorithm to reduce the size of the data (clustering, removal of fickle information) while preserving the semantic structure; then we can rely on classical but slower algorithms (HCA, graph representation) to purpose data visualization.

223035;"A graph-based multi-level linguistic representation for document understanding";5;"Pinto, D.a  and GÃ³mez-Adorno, H.a  and VilariÃ±o, D.a  and Singh, V.K.b ";"Document understanding goal requires discovery of meaningful patterns in text, which in turn requires analyzing documents and extracting information useful for a purpose. The documents to be analyzed are expected to be represented in some way. It is true that different representations of the same piece of text might have different information extraction outcomes. Therefore, it is very important to propose a reliable text representation schema that may incorporate as many features as possible, and at the same time provides use of efficient document understanding algorithms. In this paper, we propose a graph-based representation of textual documents that employs different levels of formal representation of natural language. This schema takes into account different linguistic levels, such as lexical, morphological, syntactical and semantics. The representation schema proposed is accompanied with a proposal for a technique which allows to extract useful text patterns based on the idea of minimum paths in the graph. The efficiency of the representation schema proposed has been tested in one case of study (Question-Answering for machine Reading Evaluation - QA4MRE), and the results of experiments carried in it, are described. The results obtained show that the proposed graph-based multi-level linguistic representation schema may be successfully used in the broader framework of document understanding. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

223041;"A review in feature extraction approach in question classification using Support Vector Machine";5;"Sangodiah, A.a  and Ahmad, R.b  and Ahmad, W.F.W.b ";"Text classification which is an integral part of text mining has caught much attention in various industries and fields recently. The ability is in assigning text documents to one or more pre-defined categories based on content similarity. While most of application of text classification focuses on document level, question classification works at much granular level such as sentence and phrase. There have been numerous studies on question classification in accordance to Bloom taxonomy in assessments to measure cognitive level of learners in higher learning institutions. But it has not been effective yet to resolve overlapping issue of Bloom taxonomy verb keywords being assigned to more than one category of Bloom taxonomy. The presence of this poses a problem in respect of classifying a particular question into a right category of Bloom taxonomy. And feature extraction plays an important role in improving the accuracy of classifier such as Support Vector Machine in question classification. Much of the past related research work focus on feature extraction methods such as bag of word (BOW) and syntactic analysis to classify questions and to address the issue, an improvement in feature extraction is needed. In view of this, this study proposes an integrated approach in feature extraction involving semantic aspect in classifying questions in accordance to Bloom taxonomy. Support Vector Machine classifier is used as it is well known for its high accuracy in text classification. With all this in place, an improved accuracy in classifying questions in accordance to Bloom taxonomy can be expected.

For instance, concerning a large amount of construction work on resources preparing, low query efficiency, and being unable to search out interrelated content and so on. In this paper, a relational model of semantic networks is given and a two-dimensional storage structure of relational data table based on the semantic network knowledge with practical examples is discussed. At the same time, this paper designs the stored procedure based on SQL language description; moreover its key searching skill lies in and the connections among the . The semantic network relational models, storage structure and query algorithm can solve the foregoing problems related to the knowledge or content management. That is to say it is used to inquire the contents of query system of laws and regulations, which gained excellent result.

223047;"Active learning for text classification: Using the LSI subspace signature model";5;"Zhu, W.a  and Allen, R.B.b ";"Supervised learning methods rely on large sets of labeled training examples. However, large training sets are rare and making them is expensive. In this research, Latent Semantic Indexing Subspace Signature Model (LSISSM) is applied to labeling for active learning of unstructured text. Based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), LSISSM represents terms and documents as semantic signatures by the distribution of their local statistical contribution across the top-ranking LSI latent dimensions after dimension reduction. When utilized to an unlabeled text corpus, LSISSM finds the most important samples and terms according to their global statistical contribution ranking in the corresponding LSI subspaces without prior knowledge of labels or dependency to model-loss functions of the classifiers. These sample subsets also effectively maintain the sampling distribution of the whole corpus. Furthermore, tests demonstrate that the sample subsets with the optimized term subsets substantially improve the learning accuracy across three standard classifiers.

Such challenge is caused by the massive and increasing amount of information resulting from the conversion of almost all daily tasks into digital format. Tools and applications are necessary in organizing unstructured information, which can be found in structured data, such as in relational database management systems (RDBMS). RDBMS has robust and powerful structures for managing, organizing, and retrieving data. However, structured data still contains unstructured information. In this paper, the methods used for managing unstructured data in RDBMS are investigated. In addition, an incremental and dynamic repository for managing unstructured data in relational databases are introduced. The proposed technique organizes unstructured information through linkages among textual data based on semantics. Furthermore, it provides users with a good picture of the unstructured information.

223052;"Augmenting concept definition in gloss vector semantic relatedness measure using wikipedia articles";5;"Pesaranghader, A.a  and Pesaranghader, A.b  and Rezaei, A.a ";"Semantic relatedness measures are widely used in text mining and information retrieval applications. Considering these automated measures, in this research paper we attempt to improve Gloss Vector relatedness measure for more accurate estimation of relatedness between two given concepts. Generally, this measure, by constructing concepts definitions (Glosses) from a thesaurus, tries to find the angle between the concepts gloss vectors for the calculation of relatedness. Nonetheless, this definition construction task is challenging as thesauruses do not provide full coverage of expressive definitions for the particularly specialized concepts. By employing Wikipedia articles and other external resources, we aim at augmenting these concepts definitions. Applying both definition types to the biomedical domain, using MEDLINE as corpus, UMLS as the default thesaurus, and a reference standard of 68 concept pairs manually rated for relatedness, we show exploiting available resources on the Web would have positive impact on final measurement of semantic relatedness.

223053;"Visualizing norm polarities for ethical filtering: Using color-encoded normative tag cloud";5;"Khan, A.N.a  and Muhammad, A.a  and Afraz, Z.S.a  and Martinez Enriquez, A.M.b ";"Online content has been recently subjected to ethical filtering in conformance to regional set of norms. Normative judgments are often difficult to determine the limits to dispersion and free-flow of information by state and society. Filtering unethical website content requires keyword analysis, a challenge in current manual IP filtering technologies. Due to sparse representation of objectionable words in online content, the seed sets need to focus on positive norms in order to segregate norm violations. In this research work, we exploit these polarities in norm semantics to solve the problem of ethical filtering. We scan text for belief-conforming ethical norms, and filter out words that fall below the norm threshold. Using the Noahide Norms mapped to seven colors and conforming scores, we visualize normative tag cloud. The objective of our positively oriented normative tag cloud is to conform and filter raw text according to the ethical dimensions. Our method has a high classification accuracy compared to manual gold standard. Hence, it can accurately summarize and illustrate visual comparison and contrast of cultural norms out of plain English text.

223056;"An ontology based framework for Shariah sustenance in the west";5;"Rabbi, R.";"The efficient linking of endless bits of information has not led to truly mature communication, which connects the right to the right semantic place. This deficiency is further complicated by the continuous adaptability of information to each users changing context, such as environment and objective. This phenomenon has caused greater complication within Islam, because Islamic discourses are often thousands of years old, and so have produced abundant unconnected information that lacks ontological connection. Each day the strain to link the scriptural text with everyday life is getting more difficult. Moreover, the pluralistic feature of Shariah makes it more convoluted to the lay people in the West. The framework proposed in this paper provides an automated hierarchical compilation of laws and commandments, both historical and contemporary, to develop an integral knowledge base for efficient representation and easy reasoning. Such representation and reasoning will remove the controversial shroud of Shariah by bringing transparency into the existing Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The novelty and efficiency of this knowledge base lies in a series of back end processing namely semantic text mining. This approach sort concepts, enriches the existing texts and creates greater relevancy of texts. The paper attempts to abridge three different areas. First it offers a brief overview of the Shariah life cycle. This foundation set the stage for the second area of identifying the macro scope of the integrated IT framework for Shariah. Finally, it dives deep into the logical architecture of the framework.

Mining sentiment information behind these data helps people know about public opinions and social trends. In this paper a sentiment analysis algorithm adapting to Weibo (Microblog) data is proposed. Given that a Weibo post is usually short, LDA model is used to generate text features based on semantic information instead of text structure. To decide the sentiment polar and degree, SVR model is used here. Experiment shows the algorithm performs well on Weibo data.

The difference between big data (BD) and traditional business intelligence (BI) is also heavily discussed among practitioners and scholars. We conduct a latent semantic analysis (LSA) on job advertisements harvested from the online employment platform monster.com to extract information about the knowledge and skill requirements for BD and BI professionals. By analyzing and interpreting the statistical results of the LSA, we develop a competency taxonomy for big data and business intelligence. Our major findings are that (1) business knowledge is as important as technical skills for working successfully on BI and BD initiatives; (2) BI competency is characterized by skills related to commercial products of large software vendors, whereas BD jobs ask for strong software development and statistical skills; (3) the demand for BI competencies is still far bigger than the demand for BD competencies; and (4) BD initiatives are currently much more human-capital-intensive than BI projects are. Our findings can guide individual professionals, organizations, and academic institutions in assessing and advancing their BD and BI competencies.

223072;"Generating Feature Models from Requirements: Structural vs. Functional Perspectives";5;"Itzik, N. and Reinhartz-Berger, I.";"Adoption of SPLE techniques is challenging and expensive. Hence, automation in the adoption process is desirable, especially with respect to variability management. Different methods have been suggested for (semi-)automatically generating feature models from requirements or textual descriptions of products. However, while there are different ways to represent the same SPL in feature models, addressing different stakeholders needs and preferences, existing methods usually follow fixed, predefined ways to generate feature models. As a result, the generated feature models may represent perspectives less relevant to the given tasks. In this paper we suggest an ontological approach that measures the semantic similarity, extracts variability, and automatically generates feature models that represent structural (objects-related) or functional (actions-related) perspectives. The stakeholders are able to control the perspective of the generated feature models, considering their needs and preferences for given tasks.

The semantic representation of Universal Networking Language(UNL), represents only the inherent meaning in a sentence without any syntactic details. Thus, comparing the UNL graphs of two sentences can give an insight into how semantically similar the two sentences are.

Numerous relation extractionfc techniques have been developed thus far, owing to their innate importance in the domain of information extraction and text mining. The majority of the relation extraction methods proposed to date is based on a supervised learning method requiring the use of learning collections; such learning methods can be classified into feature-based, semi-supervised, and kernel-based techniques. Among these methods, a case analysis on a kernel-based relation extraction method, considered the most successful of the three approaches, is carried out in this paper. Although some previous survey papers on this topic have been published, they failed to select the most essential of the currently available kernel-based relation extraction approaches or provide an in-depth comparative analysis of them. Unlike existing case studies, the study described in this paper is based on a close analysis of the operation principles and individual characteristics of five vital representative kernel-based relation extraction methods. In addition, we present deep comparative analysis results of these methods. In addition, for further research on kernel-based relation extraction with an even higher performance and for general high-level kernel studies for linguistic processing and text mining, some additional approaches including feature-based methods based on various criteria are introduced.

223088;"Adapting Gloss Vector semantic relatedness measure for semantic similarity estimation: An evaluation in the biomedical domain";5;"Pesaranghader, A.a  and Rezaei, A.a  and Pesaranghader, A.b ";"Automatic methods of ontology alignment are essential for establishing interoperability across web services. These methods are needed to measure semantic similarity between two ontologies entities to discover reliable correspondences. While existing similarity measures suffer from some difficulties, semantic relatedness measures tend to yield better results; even though they are not completely appropriate for the equivalence relationship (e.g. ""blood"" and ""bleeding"" related but not similar). We attempt to adapt Gloss Vector relatedness measure for similarity estimation. Generally, Gloss Vector uses angles between entities gloss vectors for relatedness calculation. After employing Pearsons chi-squared test for statistical elimination of insignificant features to optimize entities gloss vectors, by considering concepts taxonomy, we enrich them for better similarity measurement. Discussed measures get evaluated in the biomedical domain using MeSH, MEDLINE and dataset of 301 concept pairs. We conclude Adapted Gloss Vector similarity results are more correlated with human judgment of similarity compared to other measures.

223093;"Framework for document retrieval using latent semantic indexing";5;"Phadnis, N. and Gadge, J.";"Today, with the rapid development of the Internet, textual information is growing rapidly. So document retrieval which aims to find and organize relevant information in text collections is needed. With the availability of large scale inexpensive storage the amount of information stored by organizations will increase. Searching for information and deriving useful facts will become more cumbersome. How to extract a lot of information quickly and effectively has become the focus of current research and hot topics. The state of the art for traditional IR techniques is to find relevant documents depending on matching words in users query with individual words in text collections. The problem with Content-based retrieval systems is that documents relevant to a users query are not retrieved, and many unrelated or irrelevant materials are retrieved. In this paper information retrieval method is proposed based on LSI approach. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model is a concept based retrieval method that exploits the idea of vector space model and singular value decomposition.

223097;"Taking advantage of improved resource allocating network and latent semantic feature selection approach for automated text categorization";5;"Song, W. and Liang, J.Z. and He, X.L. and Chen, P.";"In this study we propose an improved learning algorithm based on resource allocating network (RAN) for text categorization. RAN is a promising neural network of single hidden layer structure based on radial basis function. We firstly use the means clustering-based method to determine the initial centers in the hidden layer. Such method can effectively overcome the limitation of local-optimal of clustering algorithms. Subsequently, in order to improve the novelty criteria of RAN, we propose a root mean square (RMS) sliding window method which can reduce the underlying influence of undesirable noise data. Through the further research on the learning process of RAN, we divide the learning process of RAN into a preliminary study phase and a subsequent study phase. The former phase initializes the preliminary structure of RAN and decreases the complexity of network, while the latter phase refines its learning ability and improves the classification accuracy. Such a compact network structure decreases the computational complexity and maintains the higher convergence rate. Moreover, a latent semantic feature selection method is utilized to organize documents. This method reduces the input scale of network, and reveals the latent semantics between features. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in comparison with state of the art text categorization algorithms.

Our evaluation of a number of popular NE recognizers over a micropost dataset has shown a significant drop-off in results quality. Current state-of-theart NER methods perform much better on formal text than on microposts. However, the experiment provided us with an interesting observation - although individual NER tools did not perform very well on micropost data, we have received recall over 90% when we merged all the results of the examined tools. This means that if we would be able to combine different NE recognizers in a meaningful way, we might be able to get NER in microposts of an acceptable quality. In this paper, we propose a method for NER in microposts, which is designed to combine annotations yielded by existing NER tools in order to produce more precise results than input tools alone. We combine NE recognizers utilizing ML techniques, namely decision tree and random forest using the C4.5 algorithm. The main advantage of the proposed method lies in the possibility of combining arbitrary NER methods and in its application on short, informal texts. The evaluation on a standard dataset shows that the proposed approach outperforms underlying NER methods as well as a baseline recognizer, which is a simple combination of the best underlying recognizers for each target NE class.

223147;"Document classification with distributions of word vectors";5;"Xing, C.a  b  and Wang, D.a  and Zhang, X.a  c  and Liu, C.a ";"The word-to-vector (W2V) technique represents words as low-dimensional continuous vectors in such a way that semantic related words are close to each other. This produces a semantic space where a word or a word collection (e.g., a document) can be well represented, and thus lends itself to a multitude of applications including document classification. Our previous study demonstrated that representations derived from word vectors are highly promising in document classification and can deliver better performance than the conventional LDA model. This paper extends the previous research and proposes to model distributions of word vectors in documents or document classes. This extends the naive approach to deriving document representations by average pooling and explores the possibility of modeling documents in the semantic space. Experiments on the sohu text database confirmed that the new approach may produce better performance on document classification.

223151;"A simple semantic kernel approach for SVM using higher-order paths";5;"Altinel, B.a  and Ganiz, M.C.b  and Diri, B.c ";"The bag of words (BOW) representation of documents is very common in text classification systems. However, the BOW approach ignores the position of the words in the document and more importantly, the semantic relations between the words. In this study, we present a simple semantic kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. This kernel uses higher-order relations between terms in order to incorporate semantic information into the SVM. This is an easy to implement algorithm which forms a basis for future improvements. We perform a serious of experiments on different well known textual datasets. Experiment results show that classification performance improves over the traditional kernels used in SVM such as linear kernel which is commonly used in text classification.

223158;"Multiple inheritance problem in semantic spreading activation networks";5;"Matykiewicz, P.a  and Duch, W.b ";"Semantic networks inspired by semantic information processing by the brain frequently do not improve the results of text classification. This counterintuitive fact is explained here by the multiple inheritance problem, which corrupts real-world knowledge representation attempts. After a review of early work on the use of semantic networks in text classification, our own heuristic solution to the problem is presented. Significance testing is used to contrast results obtained with pruned and entire semantic networks applied to medical text classification problems. The algorithm has been motivated by the process of spreading neural activation in the brain. The semantic network activation is propagated throughout the network until no more changes to the text representation are detected. Solving the multiple inheritance problem for the purpose of text classification is similar to embedding inhibition in the spreading activation process - a crucial mechanism for a healthy brain.

223161;"Towards more accurate content categorization of API discussions";5;"Zhou, B.a  and Xia, X.a  and Lo, D.b  and Tian, C.c  and Wang, X.a ";"Nowadays, software developers often discuss the usage of various APIs in online forums. Automatically assigning pre-defined semantic categorizes to API discussions in these forums could help manage the data in online forums, and assist developers to search for useful information. We refer to this process as content categorization of API discussions. To solve this problem, Hou and Mo proposed the usage of naive Bayes multinomial, which is an effective classification algorithm. In this paper, we propose a Cache-bAsed compoSitE algorithm, short formed as CASE, to automatically categorize API discussions. Considering that the content of an API discussion contains both textual description and source code, CASE has 3 components that analyze an API discussion in 3 different ways: Text, code, and original. In the text component, CASE only considers the textual description; in the code component, CASE only considers the source code; in the original component, CASE considers the original content of an API discussion which might include textual description and source code. Next, for each component, since different terms (i.e., words) have different affinities to different categories, CASE caches a subset of terms which have the highest affinity scores to each category, and builds a classifier based on the cached terms. Finally, CASE combines all the 3 classifiers to achieve a better accuracy score. We evaluate the performance of CASE on 3 datasets which contain a total of 1,035 API discussions. The experiment results show that CASE achieves accuracy scores of 0.69, 0.77, and 0.96 for the 3 datasets respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method proposed by Hou and Mo by 11%, 10%, and 2%, respectively.

Model integration software frameworks are more and more becoming web-enabled. The technologies and standards of the Web are used to access and run simulation models remotely (known as the Web of models) and are considered for enabling interoperability across model integration frameworks. Furthermore there is a growing number of local and global initiatives to provide open access to environmental data (Web of data) that can potentially be used as input for the scientific models. The availability of descriptive information of sufficient quality about the scientific models and datasets that is semantically aligned is a necessity for efforts like the Web of models and the Web of data, and for their integration. The EU FP7 project LIAISE - Linking Impact Assessment Instruments to Sustainability Expertise - is collecting and providing meta-descriptions on good practices, experts, scientific models and guidelines in its shared Impact Assessment toolbox called the LIAISE KIT. An international community of experts has been formed that provides and maintains these meta-descriptions. This knowledge base however is currently primarily targeted at a human audience and only accessible from a website. To ensure future usage initial steps are being taken in two small sub-projects of LIAISE to publish the content as part of the semantic web, and to examine the use of ontology and Natural Language Processing for metadata extraction. This has as research goal the (semi-)automated creation of relevant metadata from existing unstructured text sources such as scientific publications and websites. Preliminary results of these two sub-projects are described in this paper.

223163;"A hybrid approach to textual entailment recognition";5;"Mei, R. and Li, X. and Fu, H.";"The task of textual entailment recognition is to determine whether a text entails a hypothesis. This paper proposes a hybrid technique to identify the entailment relation between texts and hypothesis. This technique includes an approach based on lexical similarities and an approach based on the classifier of support vector machine. The approach based on lexical similarities is to use the similarities between a set of words within a text and a set of words within a hypothesis. The approach based on the classifier means to treat this task as a classification problem. We propose two kinds of classification features which include features based on semantic roles, and ones based on dependency relations and WordNet. We use our hybrid technique to integrate the two sets of experimental results by the lexical similarities-based approach and the SVM classifier-based approach. The experimental results demonstrate that our technique is effective to solve the problem of textual entailment recognition. Â© 2014.

223164;"Understanding online social networks users â€“a twitter approach";5;"Delcea, C.a  and Cotfas, L.-A.a  and Paun, R.b ";"Twitter messages, also known as tweets, are increasingly used by marketers worldwide to determine consumer sentiments towards brands, products or events. Currently, most existing approaches used for social networks sentiment analysis only extract simple feedbacks in terms of positive and negative perception. In this paper, TweetOntoSense is proposed - a semantic based approach that uses ontologies in order to infer the actual userâ€™s emotions. The extracted sentiments are described using a WordNet enriched emotional categories ontology. Thus, feelings such as happiness, affection, surprise, anger, sadness, etc. are put forth. Moreover, compared to existing approaches, TweetOntoSense also takes into consideration the fact that a single tweet message might express several, rather than a single emotion. A case study on Twitter is performed, also showing this approachâ€™s practical applicability.

Many conventional topic models represent documents as a bag-of-words, where the important linguistic structures of documents are neglected.

In addition, we propose to enforce coherent topic assignments for conceptually similar words by generalizing words with their synonyms. Our experimental studies show that the proposed model and strategy outperform the original LDA model and the Bigram Topic Model in terms of perplexity; and our performance is comparable to other models in terms of stability, coherence, and accuracy.

223171;"A frequent term-based multiple clustering approach for text documents";5;"Zheng, H.-T. and Chen, H. and Gong, S.-Q.";"With the boom of web and social network, the amount of generated text data has increased enormously. On one hand, although text clustering methods are applicable to classify text data and facilitate data mining work such as information retrieval and recommendation, inadequate aspects are still evident. Especially, most existing text clustering methods provide either a hard partitioned or a hierarchical result, which cannot describe the data from various perspectives. On the other hand, multiple clustering approaches, which are proposed to classify data with various perspectives, meet several challenges such as high time complexity and incomprehensible results while applied to text documents. In this paper, we propose a frequent term-based multiple clustering approach for text documents. Our approach classifies text documents with various perspectives and provides a semantic explanation for each cluster. Through a series of experiments, we prove that our method is more scalable and provides more comprehensible results than traditional multiple clustering methods such as OSCLU and ASCLU while applied to text documents. In addition, we also found that our approach achieves a better clustering quality than existing text clustering approaches like FTC.

223188;"Assessing MCR discussion usefulness using semantic similarity";5;"Pangsakulyanont, T.a  and Thongtanunam, P.b  and Port, D.c  and Iida, H.b ";"Modern Code Review (MCR) is an informal practice whereby reviewers virtually discuss proposed changes by adding comments through a code review tool or mailing list. It has received much research attention due to its perceived cost-effectiveness and popularity with industrial and OSS projects. Recent studies indicate there is a positive relationship between the number of review comments and code quality. However, little research exists investigating how such discussion impacts software quality. The concern is that the informality of MCR encourages a focus on trivial, tangential, or unrelated issues. Indeed, we have observed that such comments are quite frequent and may even constitute the majority. We conjecture that an effective MCR actually depends on having a substantive quantity of comments that directly impact a proposed change (or are useful). To investigate this, a necessary first step requires distinguishing review comments that are useful to a proposed change from those that are not. For a large OSS projects such as our Qt case study, manual assessment of the over 72,000 comments is a daunting task. We propose to utilize semantic similarity as a practical, cost efficient, and empirically assurable approach for assisting with the manual usefulness assessment of MCR comments. Our case study results indicate that our approach can classify comments with an average F-measure score of 0.73 and reduce comment usefulness assessment effort by about 77%.

223189;"Dependency-based semantic parsing for concept-level text analysis";5;"Poria, S.a  d  f  and Agarwal, B.b  and Gelbukh, A.c  and Hussain, A.d  and Howard, N.e ";"Concept-level text analysis is superior to word-level analysis as it preserves the semantics associated with multi-word expressions. It offers a better understanding of text and helps to significantly increase the accuracy of many text mining tasks. Concept extraction from text is a key step in concept-level text analysis. In this paper, we propose a ConceptNet-based semantic parser that deconstructs natural language text into concepts based on the dependency relation between clauses. Our approach is domain-independent and is able to extract concepts from heterogeneous text. Through this parsing technique, 92.21% accuracy was obtained on a dataset of 3,204 concepts. We also show experimental results on three different text analysis tasks, on which the proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art parsing techniques.

223190;"Designing an integrated semantic framework for structured opinion summarization";5;"Asgarian, E. and Kahani, M.";"Knowing about peoples opinions and viewpoints plays an essential role in decision-making processes involving regular customers to executive managers. Therefore, in the past decade, with the advent of Web 2.0, a new orientation of natural language processing science called opinion mining has been emerged. The main problem of exploring feature-level opinions is the complexity of feature extraction and its relations with the words containing the sentiment within unstructured texts, which reduces the accuracy of opinion mining. The purpose of the structured opinion summarization is to demonstrate the mentioned features in the reviews and express the sentiment value of users for each feature, quantitatively. The main idea of this research is to consider the semantic (knowledge) to analyze the sentiment in the review by developing the opinion ontology. Therefore, a semantic framework as an integrated method is proposed in all stages of feature-based opinion summarization.

223193;"Semantic search and NLP-based diagnostics";5;"Kats, Y.";"This study considers issues in semantic representation of written texts, especially in the context of entropy-based approach to natural language processing in biomedical applications. These issues lie at the intersection of Web search methodologies, ontology studies, lexicon studies, and natural language processing. The presented in the article entropy-based methodology is aimed at enhancing search techniques and diagnostics by capturing semantic properties of written texts. The range of possible applications ranges from forensic linguistics to psychological diagnostics and evaluation. The presented case study assumes that for texts written under atypical mental conditions, the level of relative text entropy may fall below a certain threshold and the distribution of entropy across the text may show unusual patterns, thus contributing to the semantic assessment of a subjects mental state. Further processing methods potentially contributing to psychological evaluation diagnosis and ontology-based search are discussed.

223197;"Linked knowledge sources for topic classification of microposts: A semantic graph-based approach";5;"Varga, A.a  and Basave, A.E.C.b  and Rowe, M.c  and Ciravegna, F.a  and He, Y.d ";"Short text messages a.k.a Microposts (e.g. Tweets) have proven to be an effective channel for revealing information about trends and events, ranging from those related to Disaster (e.g. hurricane Sandy) to those related to Violence (e.g. Egyptian revolution). Being informed about such events as they occur could be extremely important to authorities and emergency professionals by allowing such parties to immediately respond. In this work we study the problem of topic classification (TC) of Microposts, which aims to automatically classify short messages based on the subject(s) discussed in them. The accurate TC of Microposts however is a challenging task since the limited number of tokens in a post often implies a lack of sufficient contextual information. In order to provide contextual information to Microposts, we present and evaluate several graph structures surrounding concepts present in linked knowledge sources (KSs). Traditional TC techniques enrich the content of Microposts with features extracted only from the Microposts content. In contrast our approach relies on the generation of different weighted semantic meta-graphs extracted from linked KSs. We introduce a new semantic graph, called category meta-graph. This novel meta-graph provides a more fine grained categorisation of concepts providing a set of novel semantic features. Our findings show that such category meta-graph features effectively improve the performance of a topic classifier of Microposts. Furthermore our goal is also to understand which semantic feature contributes to the performance of a topic classifier. For this reason we propose an approach for automatic estimation of accuracy loss of a topic classifier on new, unseen Microposts. We introduce and evaluate novel topic similarity measures, which capture the similarity between the KS documents and Microposts at a conceptual level, considering the enriched representation of these documents. Extensive evaluation in the context of Emergency Response (ER) and Violence Detection (VD) revealed that our approach outperforms previous approaches using single KS without linked data and Twitter data only up to 31.4% in terms of F1 measure. Our main findings indicate that the new category graph contains useful information for TC and achieves comparable results to previously used semantic graphs. Furthermore our results also indicate that the accuracy of a topic classifier can be accurately predicted using the enhanced text representation, outperforming previous approaches considering content-based similarity measures.

223199;"Sense-specific implicative commitments";5;"De Melo, G.a  and De Paiva, V.b ";"Natural language processing systems, even when given proper syntactic and semantic interpretations, still lack the common sense inference capabilities required for genuinely understanding a sentence. Recently, there have been several studies developing a semantic classification of verbs and their sentential complements, aiming at determining which inferences people draw from them. Such constructions may give rise to implied commitments that the author normally cannot disavow without being incoherent or without contradicting herself, as described for instance in the work of Kartunnen. In this paper, we model such knowledge at the semantic level by attempting to associate such inferences with specific word senses, drawing on WordNet and VerbNet. This allows us to investigate to what extent the inferences apply to semantically equivalent words within and across languages.

223201;"Supervised semantic indexing using sub-spacing";5;"Sani, S. and Wiratunga, N. and Massie, S. and Lothian, R.";"Indexing of textual cases is commonly affected by the problem of variation in vocabulary. Semantic indexing is commonly used to address this problem by discovering semantic or conceptual relatedness between individual terms and using this to improve textual case representation. However, representations produced using this approach are not optimal for supervised tasks because standard semantic indexing approaches do not take into account class membership of these textual cases. Supervised semantic indexing approaches e.g. sprinkled Latent Semantic Indexing (SPLSI) and supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA) have been proposed for addressing this limitation. However, both SPLSI and SLDA are computationally expensive and require parameter tuning. In this work, we present an approach called Supervised Sub-Spacing (S3) for supervised semantic indexing of documents. S3 works by creating a separate sub-space for each class within which class-specific term relations and term weights are extracted. The power of S3 lies in its ability to modify document representations such that documents that belong to the same class are made more similar to one another while, at the same time, reducing their similarity to documents of other classes. In addition, S3 is flexible enough to work with a variety of semantic relatedness metrics and yet, powerful enough that it leads to significant improvements in text classification accuracy. We evaluate our approach on a number of supervised datasets and results show classification performance on S3-based representations to significantly outperform both a supervised version of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) called Sprinkled LSI, and supervised LDA.

This paper presents a principled approach to semantic entailment problem that builds on a concept-based knowledge representation model (CKR). This model formally defines the concept as a triple (attribute, relation and behavior) and the knowledge of a concept can be illustrated by the triple. We propose a semantic inference strategy that against identify text segments which with dissimilar surface form but share a common meaning. The inference strategy avoids syntactic analysis steps. A preliminary evaluation on the PASCAL text collection is presented. Experimental results show that our concept-based inference strategy is effective and has strong development potential.

We address these challenges by proposing two unsupervised clustering approaches. In the first approach, we generate a semantic space representation for each tweet by keyword expansion and keyphrase identification. In the second approach, we transform each tweet into a conceptual space that represents the latent concepts of the tweet. We empirically show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

It is well understood that semantic associations from text can be discerned by observing patterns of co-occurrences of terms. However, much of the work in this direction has been piecemeal, addressing specific kinds of semantic associations. In this work, we propose a generic framework, using which several kinds of semantic associations can be mined. The framework comprises a co-occurrence graph of terms, along with a set of graph operators. A methodology for using this framework is also proposed, where the properties of a given semantic association can be hypothesized and tested over the framework. To show the generic nature of the proposed model, four different semantic associations are mined over a corpus comprising of Wikipedia articles.

223237;"Supervised semantic analysis of product reviews using weighted k-NN classifier";5;"Srivastava, A. and Singh, M.P. and Kumar, P.";"On line shopping, today, has become the call of the day. People are showing more inclination towards on line shops, due to large variety of options at fingertips, ease of access, access to global products. Further the buyer also benefits from information regarding user review of products, comparison of similar products etc. Therefore the importance of product review is also escalating exponentially. Most of the existing sentiment analysis systems require large training datasets and complex tools for implementation. This paper presents a Two-Parse algorithm with a training dataset of approximately 7,000 keywords, for automatic product review analysis. The proposed algorithm is more efficient as compared to some of the popular review analysis systems with enormous datasets. This algorithm is a solution to a very common problem of high polarity of datasets. This paper proposes a Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (Weighted k-NN) Classifier which achieves a better efficiency than the classical k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. The proposed Classifier is capable of successfully classifying weakly and mildly polar reviews along with the highly polar ones. The Classifier provides an option of modifying the parameters according to need of the system and thus overcomes the problem of static parameters in classical machine learning algorithms.

223241;"Sentiment analysis of short informal texts";5;"Kiritchenko, S. and Zhu, X. and Mohammad, S.M.";"We describe a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis system that detects (a) the sentiment of short informal textual messages such as tweets and SMS (message-level task) and (b) the sentiment of a word or a phrase within a message (term-level task). The system is based on a supervised statistical text classification approach leveraging a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. The sentiment features are primarily derived from novel high-coverage tweet-specific sentiment lexicons. These lexicons are automatically generated from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags and from tweets with emoticons. To adequately capture the sentiment of words in negated contexts, a separate sentiment lexicon is generated for negated words. The system ranked first in the SemEval-2013 shared task Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Task 2), obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. Post-competition improvements boost the performance to an F-score of 70.45 (message-level task) and 89.50 (term-level task). The system also obtains state-of-the-art performance on two additional datasets: the SemEval-2013 SMS test set and a corpus of movie review excerpts. The ablation experiments demonstrate that the use of the automatically generated lexicons results in performance gains of up to 6.5 absolute percentage points.

223245;"Semantic compression for text document processing";5;"Ceglarek, D.";"Ongoing research on novel methods and tools that can be applied in Natural Language Processing tasks has resulted in the design of a semantic compression mechanism. Semantic compression is a technique that allows for correct generalization of terms in some given context. Thanks to this generalization a common thought can be detected. The rules governing the generalization process are based on a data structure which is referred to as a domain frequency dictionary. Having established the domain for a given text fragment the disambiguation of possibly many hypernyms becomes a feasible task. Semantic compression, thus an informed generalization, is possible through the use of semantic networks as a knowledge representation structure. In the given overview, it is worth noting that the semantic compression allows for a number of improvements in comparison to already established Natural Language Processing techniques. These improvements, along with a detailed discussion of the various elements of algorithms and data structures that are necessary to make semantic compression a viable solution, are the core of this work. Semantic compression can be applied in a variety of scenarios, e.g. in detection of plagiarism. With increasing effort being spent on developing semantic compression, new domains of application have been discovered. What is more, semantic compression itself has evolved and has been refined by the introduction of new solutions that boost the level of disambiguation efficiency. Thanks to the remodeling of already existing data sources to suit algorithms enabling semantic compression, it has become possible to use semantic compression as a base for automata that, thanks to the exploration of hypernym-hyponym and synonym relations, new concepts that may be included in the knowledge representation structures can now be discovered.

223246;"Discovering relations by entity search in lightweight semantic text graphs";5;"LaclavÃ­k, M. and DlugolinskÃ½, Å . and Ciglan, M.";"Entity search is becoming a popular alternative for full text search. Recently Google released its entity search based on confirmed, human-generated data such as Wikipedia. In spite of these developments, the task of entity discovery, search, or relation search in unstructured text remains a major challenge in the fields of information retrieval and information extraction. This paper tries to address that challenge, focusing specifically on entity relation discovery. This is achieved by processing unstructured text using simple information extraction methods, building lightweight semantic graphs and reusing them for entity relation discovery by applying algorithms from graph theory. An important part is also user interaction with semantic graphs, which can significantly improve information extraction results and entity relation search. Entity relations can be discovered by various text mining methods, but the advantage of the presented method lies in the similarity between the lightweight semantics extracted from a text and the information networks available as structured data. Both graph structures have similar properties and similar relation discovery algorithms can be applied. In addition, we can benefit from the integration of such graph data.

223247;"Mining large-scale event knowledge from Web text";5;"Cao, Y.-N. and Zhang, P. and Guo, J. and Guo, L.";"This paper addresses the problem of automatic acquisition of semantic relations between events. While previous works on semantic relation automatic acquisition relied on annotated text corpus, it is still unclear how to develop more generic methods to meet the needs of identifying related event pairs and extracting event-arguments (especially the predicate, subject and object). Motivated by this limitation, we develop a three-phased approach that acquires causality from the Web text. First, we use explicit connective markers (such as ""because"") as linguistic cues to discover causal related events. Next, we extract the event-arguments based on local dependency parse trees of event expressions. At the last step, we propose a statistical model to measure the potential causal relations. The results of our empirical evaluations on a large-scale Web text corpus show that (a) the use of local dependency tree extensively improves both the accuracy and recall of event-arguments extraction task, and (b) our measure improves the traditional PMI method.

223248;"A correlation-based semantic model for text search";5;"Sun, J. and Wang, B. and Yang, X.";"With the exponential growth of texts on the Internet, text search is considered a crucial problem in many fields. Most of the traditional text search approaches are based on ""bag of words"" text representation based on frequency statics. However, these approaches ignore the semantic correlation of words in the text. So this may lead to inaccurate ranking of the search results. In this paper, we propose a new Wikipedia-based similar text search approach that the words in the texts and query text could be semantic correlated in Wikipedia. We propose a new text representation model and a new text similarity metric. Finally, the experiments on the real dataset demonstrate the high precision, recall and efficiency of our approach.

Marketing or sales people do analysis on their products reach using surveys, feedback and queries etc. using online forms. All these unstructured text and voluminous data have to be analyzed manually or semi-automatically to understand the context and make decisions on the business. Similarly to buy any products online, people usually search and get opinion on the products from friends before taking their decisions. Whenever a new product is launched in the market, the social networking sites are deluged with reviews and comments about the product. We can exploit this to the advantage of determining the reach of the product among the common mass by applying sentiment analysis over these reviews. The use of this is twofold-(i) The seller gets first-hand information about the products reach (ii) Buyer can buy the right product for his need. In this paper, we propose a model to store the product information as ontologies, thereby bringing strong relationships among the data stored. We add more semantics by embedding the opinions, determined using sentiment analysis, within the linked data thereby accounting for better reasoning and efficient querying. We propose a method to perform opinion mining on products by extracting the comments on products features from the reviews posted in a micro-blogging site such as twitter. The sentiment analysis is done on these reviews to rate the product features. These opinions are stored along with the product-feature descriptions in the domain ontology in OWL format. Once the opinions are embedded in the ontology, the model can serve for better reasoning and answering intelligent queries. This information can also be recommended to the people who are in need when they search for similar products which help them to make necessary decisions based on the others opinions.

223257;"Visualization of online customer reviews and evaluations based on self-organizing map";5;"Saitoh, F.";"In recent times, it has become easier to collect large quantities of customer reviews of products and services through the Internet. Thus, text-mining has become evermore important for various businesses. However, current techniques to visualize the correspondence relation between customer reviews and evaluation information are insufficient. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new method of visualizing information using a Self-organizing Map(SOM) that is robust for text data that is non-linear and multi-collinear. Our method involves, probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) which does not require weighting for the dimension contraction of a word vector. Furthermore, we also propose a method to visualize the distribution of evaluation information on SOM. In order to assign a suitable value to dead nodes and nodes without evaluation values, we redefine the interpolation formula for the evaluation value. To confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposal, we use our method to visualize customer review data on a major E-Commerce website.

223259;"Applying grammar induction to text mining";5;"Salway, A.a  and Touileb, S.b ";"We report the first steps of a novel investigation into how a grammar induction algorithm can be modified and used to identify salient information structures in a corpus. The information structures are to be used as representations of semantic content for text mining purposes. We modify the learning regime of the ADIOS algorithm (Solan et al., 2005) so that text is presented as increasingly large snippets around key terms, and instances of selected structures are substituted with common identifiers in the input for subsequent iterations. The technique is applied to 1.4m blog posts about climate change which mention diverse topics and reflect multiple perspectives and different points of view. Observation of the resulting information structures suggests that they could be useful as representations of semantic content. Preliminary analysis shows that our modifications had a beneficial effect for inducing more useful structures.

223260;"Research of Semantic Role Labeling and application in patent knowledge extraction";5;"Meng, L. and He, Y. and Li, Y.";"Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a leading task of identifying arguments for a predicate and assigning semantically meaningful labels to them. SRL is crucial to information extraction, question answering, and machine translation. When applied to patent text, existing tools for SRL have unsatisfying performance because of long sentences. To improve performance in patent SRL systems, this study separates each sentence in patent abstracts into a simpler structure, and then labels semantic roles for the simplified sentence. At last, semantic information and semantic framework for frequently used words are used to extract patent knowledge. Our work demonstrates that the method used in this article can improve the performance in SRL system and obtain beneficial knowledge from patents.

223262;"Using graphs and semantic information to improve text classifiers";5;"Das, N.a  and Ghosh, S.a  and Gon Ã‡ Alves, T.b  and Quaresma, P.b  c ";"Text classification using semantic information is the latest trend of research due to its greater potential to accurately represent text content compared with bag-of-words (BOW) approaches. On the other hand, representation of semantics through graphs has several advantages over the traditional representation of feature vector. Therefore, error tolerant graph matching techniques can be used for text classification. Nevertheless, very few methodologies exist in the literature which use semantic representation through graphs. In the present work, a methodology has been proposed to represent semantic information from a summarized text into a graph. The discourse representation structure of a text is utilized in order to represent its semantic content and, afterwards, it is transformed into a graph. Five different graph matching techniques based on Maximum Common Subgraphs (mcs) and Minimum Common Supergraphs (MCS) are evaluated on 20 classes from the Reuters dataset taking 10 docs of each class for both training and testing purposes using the k-NN classifier. From the results it can be observed that the technique has potential to perform text classification as well as the traditional BOW approaches. Moreover a majority voting based combination of the semantic representation and a traditional BOW approach provided an improved recognition accuracy on the same data set.

223267;"Automatic rules extraction from medical texts";5;"Boufrida, A. and Boufaida, Z.";"The majority of existing knowledge is encoded in unstructured texts and is not linked to formalized knowledge, like ontologies and rules.

We specifically focus on Twitter. Since short texts do not provide sufficient word occurrences, and they often contain abbreviations and acronyms, traditional classification methods such as quot;Bag-of-Wordsquot; have limitations. Our proposed method enriches the original text with a new set of words, to add more semantic value by using information extracted from webpages of the same temporal context. Then we use those words to query Wikipedia, as an external knowledge base, with the final goal to categorize the original text using a predefined set of Wikipedia categories.

223270;"Ontology-based text classification into dynamically defined topics";5;"Allahyari, M.a  and Kochut, K.J.a  and Janik, M.b ";"We present a method for the automatic classification of text documents into a dynamically defined set of topics of interest. The proposed approach requires only a domain ontology and a set of user-defined classification topics, specified as contexts in the ontology. Our method is based on measuring the semantic similarity of the thematic graph created from a text document and the ontology sub-graphs resulting from the projection of the defined contexts. The domain ontology effectively becomes the classifier, where classification topics are expressed using the defined ontological contexts. In contrast to the traditional supervised categorization methods, the proposed method does not require a training set of documents. More importantly, our approach allows dynamically changing the classification topics without retraining of the classifier. In our experiments, we used the English language Wikipedia converted to an RDF ontology to categorize a corpus of current Web news documents into selection of topics of interest. The high accuracy achieved in our tests demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, as well as the applicability of Wikipedia for semantic text categorization purposes.

For sports video, most previous works detect events by video content itself. Some useful external knowledge has been researched recently. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised approach to extract semantic events from sports webcast text. First, unrelated words in the descriptions of webcast text are filtered out, and then the filtered descriptions are clustered into significant event categories. Finally, the keywords for each event category are extracted. According to our experimental results, the proposed approach actually extracts significant text events, which can be used for further video indexing and summarization.

Notice how methods to account for compositional linguistic structures (e.g. grammatically typed bi-grams or complex verb or noun phrases) have been proposed recently by defining algebras on lexical vectors. The result is an extended paradigm called Distributional Compositional Semantics (DCS). Although lexical extensions have been already proposed to generalize TKs towards semantic phenomena (e.g. the predicate argument structures as for role labeling), currently studied TKs do not account for compositionality, in general. In this paper, a novel kernel called Compositionally Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel is proposed to integrate DCS operators into the tree kernel evaluation, by acting both over lexical leaves and non-terminal, i.e. complex compositional, nodes. The empirical results obtained on a Question Classification and Paraphrase Identification tasks show that state-of-the-art performances can be achieved, without resorting to manual feature engineering, thus suggesting that a large set of Web and text mining tasks can be handled successfully by the kernel proposed here.

223297;"An ensemble approach for text document clustering using wikipedia concepts";5;"Nourashrafeddin, S. and Milios, E. and Arnold, D.V.";"Most text clustering algorithms represent a corpus as a document-term matrix in the bag of words model. The feature values are computed based on term frequencies in documents and no semantic relatedness between terms is considered. Therefore, two semantically similar documents may sit in different clusters if they do not share any terms. One solution to this problem is to enrich the document representation using an external resource like Wikipedia. We propose a new way to integrate Wikipedia concepts in partitional text document clustering in this work. A text corpus is first represented as a document-term matrix and a documentconcept matrix. Terms that exist in the corpus are then clustered based on the document-term representation. Given the term clusters, we propose two methods, one based on the document-term representation and the other one based on the document-concept representation, to find two sets of seed documents. The two sets are then used in our text clustering algorithm in an ensemble approach to cluster documents. The experimental results show that even though the documentconcept representations do not result in good document clusters per se, integrating them in our ensemble approach improves the quality of document clusters significantly.

223299;"Automated query analysis techniques for semantics based question answering system";5;"Prabhumoye, S. and Rai, P. and Sandhu, L.S. and Priya, L. and Sowmya Kamath, S.";"Search engines have always played an important role in helping web users to rapidly find information on the Web. However, their function is limited to returning a list of query relevant documents with reasonably good precision, but huge recall. The task of actually processing the returned documents to get the required information is the responsibility of the user. In recent years, Question-Answer systems are gaining popularity and have garnered much research interest in view of the proposed Semantic Web and future availability of fully structured data. The advantage of QA systems is that users have the luxury of asking queries in natural language and also get a precise answer instead of just displaying a list of links to documents that may or may not be relevant. This paper presents a question answer search engine prototype that uses natural language processing, natural language generation, question classification and query logs to find a precise answer to the submitted query. This is ongoing work and we focus on the methodology of query analysis in this paper. We describe our strategy of automatic query analysis by classifying it into nine categories and understanding the meaning of the query. We also discuss in detail how each of the question categories are automatically processed and how the proposed system determines the key word or key phrase to be searched.

223300;"Semantic multidimensional scaling for open-domain sentiment analysis";5;"Cambria, E.a  and Song, Y.b  and Wang, H.c  and Howard, N.d ";"The ability to understand natural language text is far from being emulated in machines. One of the main hurdles to overcome is that computers lack both the common and common-sense knowledge that humans normally acquire during the formative years of their lives. To really understand natural language, a machine should be able to comprehend this type of knowledge, rather than merely relying on the valence of keywords and word co-occurrence frequencies. In this article, the largest existing taxonomy of common knowledge is blended with a natural-language-based semantic network of common-sense knowledge. Multidimensional scaling is applied on the resulting knowledge base for open-domain opinion mining and sentiment analysis.

Whilst semantic information has been reconed crucial for Chinese syntactic analysis and downstream applications, existing Chinese treebanks lack a consistent and strict sentential semantic formalism. In this paper, we introduce a semantics oriented grammar for Chinese, designed to provide basic supports for tasks such as automatic semantic parsing and sentence generation. It has a directed acyclic graph structure with a simple yet expressive label set, and leverages elementary predication to support logical form conversion. To our knowledge, it is the first Chinese grammar representation capable of direct transformation into logical forms.

Recent work has focused on using contextual clues for semantic similarity computation. In this paper, we propose a method to the measure semantic similarity between words using plain text contents. It takes into account information attributes (local) and topic information (global) of words to disclose their semantic similarity scores. The method models the representation of a word as a high dimensional vector of word attributes and latent topics. Thus, the semantic similarity between two words is measured by the semantic distance between their respective vectors. We have tested the proposed method on WordSimilarity-353 dataset.

Our feature selection method is general and useful for other applications involving text-based analysis as well. Our email body-text-only classifier classifier achieves more than 95% accuracy on detecting phishing emails with a false positive rate of 2.24 %.

223308;"Discovering novel protein-protein interactions by measuring the protein semantic similarity from the biomedical literature";5;"Chiang, J.-H. and Ju, J.-H.";"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in the majority of biological processes. Identification of PPIs is therefore one of the key aims of biological research. Although there are many databases of PPIs, many other unidentified PPIs could be buried in the biomedical literature. Therefore, automated identification of PPIs from biomedical literature repositories could be used to discover otherwise hidden interactions. Search engines, such as Google, have been successfully applied to measure the relatedness among words. Inspired by such approaches, we propose a novel method to identify PPIs through semantic similarity measures among protein mentions. We define six semantic similarity measures as features based on the page counts retrieved from the MEDLINE database. A machine learning classifier, Random Forest, is trained using the above features. The proposed approach achieve an averaged micro-F of 71.28% and an averaged macro-F of 64.03% over five PPI corpora, an improvement over the results of using only the conventional co-occurrence feature (averaged micro-F of 68.79% and an averaged macro-F of 60.49%). A relation-word reinforcement further improves the averaged micro-F to 71.3% and averaged macro-F to 65.12%. Comparing the results of the current work with other studies on the AIMed corpus (ranging from 77.58% to 85.1% in micro-F, 62.18% to 76.27% in macro-F), we show that the proposed approach achieves micro-F of 81.88% and macro-F of 64.01% without the use of sophisticated feature extraction. Finally, we manually examine the newly discovered PPI pairs based on a literature review, and the results suggest that our approach could extract novel protein-protein interactions.

Text mining is an emerging technique for mining useful information from the web. We aim at discovering in particular tweets semantic patterns in consumers discussions on social media. Specifically, the purposes of this study are twofold: 1) finding similarity and dissimilarity between two sets of textual documents that include consumers sentiment polarities, two forms of positive vs. negative opinions and 2) driving actual content from the textual data that has a semantic trend. The considered tweets include consumers opinions on US retail companies (e.g., Amazon, Walmart). Cosine similarity and K-means clustering methods are used to achieve the former goal, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic modeling algorithm, is used for the latter purpose. This is the first study which discover semantic properties of textual data in consumption context beyond sentiment analysis. In addition to major findings, we apply LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocations) to the same data and drew latent topics that represent consumers positive opinions and negative opinions on social media.

Our system is based on a cross-language semantic matching method that i) translates service labels in English using a machine translation tool, ii) extracts a Wikipedia-based semantic representation from the translated service labels using Explicit Semantic Analysis (esa), iii) evaluates the similarity between two services using their Wikipedia-based representations. The user selects a service in a source catalog and exploits the ranked list of matches suggested by CroSeR to establish a relation (of type narrower, equivalent, or broader match) with other services in the English catalog. The method is independent from the language adopted in the source catalog and it does not assume the availability of information about the services other than very short text descriptions used as service labels.

223348;"Applying latent semantic analysis to optimize second-order co-occurrence vectors for semantic relatedness measurement";5;"Pesaranghader, A.a  and Pesaranghader, A.b  and Rezaei, A.a ";"Measures of semantic relatedness are largely applicable in intelligent tasks of NLP and Bioinformatics. By taking these automated measures into account, this paper attempts to improve Second-order Co-occurrence Vector semantic relatedness measure for more effective estimation of relatedness between two given concepts. Typically, this measure, after constructing concepts definitions (Glosses) from a thesaurus, considers the cosine of the angle between the concepts gloss vectors as the degree of relatedness. Nonetheless, these computed gloss vectors of concepts are impure and rather large in size which would hinder the expected performance of the measure. By employing latent semantic analysis (LSA), we try to conduct some level of insignificant feature elimination to generate economic gloss vectors. Applying both approaches to the biomedical domain, using MEDLINE as corpus, UMLS as thesaurus, and reference standard of biomedical concept-pairs manually rated for relatedness, we show LSA implementation enforces positive impact in terms of performance and efficiency.

223350;"Sequential pattern based multi document summarization - An exploratory approach";5;"Alias, S.a  and Muhammad, S.K.b ";"Sequential Pattern Mining which aims to discover all frequent sequences of itemsets (patterns) from a large data collection has been applied in the Text Mining domain such as Text Categorization and Pattern Identification. However, in the area of Document Summarization the effort is still considered as green and exploratory. In the real world, a sentence is more than just a collection of un-ordered sequence of words, where each sentence carries their own meaning. By discovering these textual patterns is essential since the patterns can describe the text, by preserving the sequential order of the words in the document. Thus, the motivation here is to investigate the feasibility to develop a Sequential Pattern-based Summarizer model near future in order to reduce redundancy information from multiple text resources; at same time preserving the meaning of the original text document using the Semantic similarity approach. This paper reviewed some of the existing techniques in the area of multiple document summarizations to better understand the gap and issues underlying this area. By incorporating the semantic knowledge of sentences in the multiple documents is hoped to assist and alleviate the long-winding process for non-subject expert researches in trying to find the similarities and correlation between text resources.

223352;"Defining semantic meta-hashtags for twitter classification";5;"Costa, J.a  b  and Silva, C.a  b  and Antunes, M.a  c  and Ribeiro, B.b ";"Given the wide spread of social networks, research efforts to retrieve information using tagging from social networks communications have increased. In particular, in Twitter social network, hashtags are widely used to define a shared context for events or topics. While this is a common practice often the hashtags freely introduced by the user become easily biased. In this paper, we propose to deal with this bias defining semantic meta-hashtags by clustering similar messages to improve the classification. First, we use the user-defined hashtags as the Twitter message class labels. Then, we apply the meta-hashtag approach to boost the performance of the message classification. The meta-hashtag approach is tested in a Twitter-based dataset constructed by requesting public tweets to the Twitter API. The experimental results yielded by comparing a baseline model based on user-defined hashtags with the clustered meta-hashtag approach show that the overall classification is improved. It is concluded that by incorporating semantics in the meta-hashtag model can have impact in different applications, e.g. recommendation systems, event detection or crowdsourcing.

However, computational methods and tools available to explore this data are still limited in functionality. Research on historical archives is still largely carried out manually. Text mining technologies offer novel methods to analyse digital content to identify various types of semantic information in these documents and to extract them as semantic metadata. Methods range from the automatic identification of named entities (e.g., people, places, organisations, etc.) to more sophisticated methods to extract information about events (e.g., births, deaths, arrests, etc.), allowing users to greatly increase the specificity of their search. We have created an extended model of event interpretation to allow searches to be refined based on various discourse facets, including isolating definite information about events from more speculative details, distinguishing positive and negative opinions and categorising events according to information source. We present ISHER as an example of a multi-faceted, semantically oriented system for searching news articles from the New York Times, dating back to 1987. We explain how our extended event interpretation model can enhance search capabilities in systems such as ISHER, including the identification of contrasting and contradictory information in news articles.

223356;"Cross-language semantic retrieval and linking of e-gov services";5;"Narducci, F.a  and Palmonari, M.a  and Semeraro, G.b ";"Public administrations are aware of the advantages of sharing Open Government Data in terms of transparency, development of improved services, collaboration between stakeholders, and spurring new economic activities. Initiatives for the publication and interlinking of government service catalogs as Linked Open Data (lod) support the interoperability among European administrations and improve the capability of foreign citizens to access services across Europe. However, linking service catalogs to reference lod catalogs requires a significant effort from local administrations, preventing the uptake of interoperable solutions at a large scale. The web application presented in this paper is named CroSeR (Cross-language Service Retriever) and supports public bodies in the process of linking their own service catalogs to the lod cloud. CroSeR supports different European languages and adopts a semantic representation of e-gov services based on Wikipedia. CroSeR tries to overcome problems related to the short textual descriptions associated to a service by embodying a semantic annotation algorithm that enriches service labels with emerging Wikipedia concepts related to the service. An experimental evaluation carried-out on e-gov service catalogs in five different languages shows the effectiveness of our model.

Our method effectively mines semantic expansion beyond the text surface of relation mentions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve 74.4% average accuracy for open relation mapping.

223361;"T2R: System for converting textual documents into RDF triples";5;"Hassanzadeh, K.a  and Reformat, M.a  and Pedrycz, W.a  and Jamal, I.b  and Berezowski, J.c ";"An important contribution of the Semantic Web is a new format of data representation called Resource Description Framework (RDF). In RDF, every piece of information is represented as a triple: subject-property-object. In general, subjects and objects can be shared between multiple RDF triples, and all triples can constitute a densely interlinked network. RDF becomes a very popular format of representing data on the web. As of September 2012, the last available data, more than 31 billions of triples exist on the web. In the paper, we propose a system - called T2R - for automatic acquisition of syntactic and semantic relations among terms from a plain text. These relations are expressed in the form of RDF triples. The proposed method is independent of any prior knowledge and domain specific patterns, and is applicable to any textual resources. The system implementing the approach is capable of identifying grammatical structure of an input sentence and analysing its semantics to generate meaningful RDF triples. We evaluate this approach by proving the quality of our results through case studies.

223378;"Improving multi-term topics focused crawling by introducing term Frequency-Information Content (TF-IC) measure";5;"Pesaranghader, A.a  and Pesaranghader, A.b  and Mustapha, N.a  and Sharef, N.M.a ";"By rapid growth of the Internet, finding desirable information would be a challenging and time consuming task. In order to tackle this issue, focused crawlers, as the ideal solution, through mining of the Web, help us to find web pages closely relevant to the desired information. For this purpose, a variety of methods are devised and implemented. Nonetheless, the majority of these methods do not favor more informative terms in a given multi-term topic. In this paper, we propose a new measure called Term Frequency-Information Content (TF-IC) to prioritize terms in a multi-term topic accordingly. Through conducted experiments, we compare our measure against both Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) measures applied in focused crawlers. Experimental results indicate superiority of our measure over TF-IDF and LSI for collecting more relevant web pages of both general and specialized multi-term topics.

In this paper we present a demonstration of such tool combining Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), linguistic frame semantics, and Ontology Design Patterns (ODP). The tool is based on Boxer which implements a DRT-compliant deep parser. The logical output of Boxer enriched with semantic data from Verbnet or Framenet frames is transformed into RDF/OWL by means of a mapping model and a set of heuristics following ODP best-practice [5] of OWL ontologies and RDF data design.

It performs multi-scale analysis on a set of points and identifies clusters, holes, and voids therein. These latter topological structures complement standard feature representations, making persistent homology an attractive feature extractor for artificial intelligence. Research on persistent homology for AI is in its infancy, and is currently hindered by two issues: the lack of an accessible introduction to AI researchers, and the paucity of applications. In response, the first part of this paper presents a tutorial on persistent homology specifically aimed at a broader audience without sacrificing mathematical rigor. The second part contains one of the first applications of persistent homology to natural language processing. Specifically, our Similarity Filtration with Time Skeleton (SIFTS) algorithm identifies holes that can be interpreted as semantic ""tie-backs"" in a text document, providing a new document structure representation.

223393;"Unsupervised mining of frequent tags for clinical eligibility text indexing";5;"Miotto, R.a  and Weng, C.a  b ";"Clinical text, such as clinical trial eligibility criteria, is largely underused in state-of-the-art medical search engines due to difficulties of accurate parsing. This paper proposes a novel methodology to derive a semantic index for clinical eligibility documents based on a controlled vocabulary of frequent tags, which are automatically mined from the text. We applied this method to eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov and report that frequent tags (1) define an effective and efficient index of clinical trials and (2) are unlikely to grow radically when the repository increases. We proposed to apply the semantic index to filter clinical trial search results and we concluded that frequent tags reduce the result space more efficiently than an uncontrolled set of UMLS concepts. Overall, unsupervised mining of frequent tags from clinical text leads to an effective semantic index for the clinical eligibility documents and promotes their computational reuse.

The unsupervised constraints are automatically derived from existing knowledge sources, thus saving the effort and cost of using manually labeled constraints. To achieve our first goal, we develop a two-sided hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model to represent both document and word constraints. We then use an alternating expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the model. We also propose two novel methods to automatically construct and incorporate document and word constraints to support unsupervised constrained clustering: 1) automatically construct document constraints based on overlapping named entities (NE) extracted by an NE extractor; 2) automatically construct word constraints based on their semantic distance inferred from WordNet.

This paper defines a collective classification approach employing the prior knowledge at test time, naturally reusing most of the mathematical apparatus developed for standard SBR.

223588;"Leveraging social network analysis with topic models and the Semantic Web (extended)";5;"RÃ­os, S.A.a  and Aguilera, F.b  and Bustos, F.b  and Omitola, T.c  and Shadbolt, N.c ";"Research in the Semantic Web, especially in modeling virtual communities, has provided models useful to represent the richness of these social network interactions. The SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities) vocabulary provides concepts and properties that can be used to describe information from online communities (e.g., message boards, wikis, weblogs, etc.). However, the SIOC ontology does not consider social aspects nor the higher order semantics hidden in linkages between community members. This paper describes SIOC-SNA-DM, an extension of the SIOC vocabulary. SIOC-SNA-DMs model is tri-partite, consisting of People, Policies, and Purposes which are social aspects observable in most social communities. A challenge to using our model is how to populate these aspects, since higher order semantics from interactions need to be extracted. Thus, we explain how this population is done with advanced text mining using a latent semantic technique over a large virtual community called Plexilandia.cl with more than 2500 musicians working on the site. Our previous work, in this area, has shown how including these social aspects help to outperform results generated by state-of-the-art techniques.

223598;"Automatic text categorization of marathi documents using clustering technique";5;"Vispute, S.R.a  and Potey, M.A.b ";"The purpose of the present work is creating an intelligent system to retrieve desired documents in Marathi language. The system also focuses on providing the personalized documents in Marathi language to the end user based on their interests identified from the browsing history. This paper presents the automatic categorization of Marathi documents and the literature survey of the related work done in automatic categorization of text documents. Several supervised learning techniques are exists for the classification of text documents namely Decision trees, Support Vector machine (SVM), Neural Network, Ada Boost and NaÃ¯ve Bayes etc. Several clustering techniques are also available for text categorization namely K-means, Suffix Tree Clustering (STC), Semantic Online Hierarchical Clustering (SHOC), Label Induction Grouping Algorithm (LINGO) etc. In the literature survey it is found that vector space model (VSM) gives better result than probabilistic model. This paper presents categorization of the Marathi text documents using Lingo Clustering algorithm based on VSM. The data set consists of 107 Marathi documents of 3 different categories-Tourism, Health Programmes and Maharashtra festivals. The result shows that the performance of the LINGO clustering algorithm is good for categorizing the Marathi text documents. For the Marathi documents overall accuracy of the system is 91.10%.

223599;"Enrichment of BOW Representation with Syntactic and Semantic Background Knowledge";5;"Alfred, R.a  and Anthony, P.b  and Alias, S.a  and Tahir, A.a  and Chin, K.O.a  and Keng, L.H.a ";"The basic Bag of Words (BOW) representation, that is generally used in text documents clustering or categorization, loses important syntactic and semantic information contained in the documents. When the text document contains a lot of stop words or when they are of a short length this may be particularly problematic. In this paper, we study the contribution of incorporating syntactic features and semantic knowledge into the representation in clustering texts corpus. We investigate the quality of clusters produced when incorporating syntactic and semantic information into the representation of text documents by analyzing the internal structure of the cluster using the Davies- Bouldin (DBI) index. This paper studies and compares the quality of the clusters produced when four different sets of text representation used to cluster texts corpus. These text representations include the standard BOW representation, the standard BOW representation integrated with syntactic features, the standard BOW representation integrated with semantic background knowledge and finally the standard BOW representation integrated with both syntactic features and semantic background knowledge. Based on the experimental results, it is shown that the quality of clusters produced is improved by integrating the semantic and syntactic information into the standard bag of words representation of texts corpus.

Due to short knowledge and lack in background information of conversation corpus which related to the pragmatic, there is a long way to go for computer fully understand natural language. In this paper, the pragmatic features were added to the text vector space model of language spoken conversation, and hierarchical clustering is executed. Our experimental results show that the clustering effect with pragmatic features outperforms than non-pragmatic features, and precision, recall rate and F values of the former were increased by 6.67%, 6.34% and 6.6%, respectively.

223603;"DAG based feature additive XML schema generation for unstructured text";5;"Rajbabu, K.a  and Sudha, S.b ";"Recent works on handling unstructured text employ multilevel filtering techniques for identifying the key terms in documents and then apply mining techniques to extract necessary information. Though these techniques are more efficient in information retrieval, they cannot be applied directly for information extraction, for documents that are more critical in context and also accuracy cannot be expected. Further, loss of hidden and significant information cannot be tolerated in data critical applications emerging based on unstructured documents. Hence, a novel idea of re-organizing the unstructured textual model into feature enriched structured graphical model by adding spatial, logical, lexical, syntactical and semantic features is proposed. The generated graph depicts relationships across the document at all levels from its micro level token to macro level document. Moreover, a structural pattern identification algorithm for generating an XML schema from the generated graph is also recommended. The experimental outcome for a real-time dataset is presented.

223604;"Semantics preserved concept based mining model";5;"Seena, M.S. and Velayudhan, R.";"Most of the text retrieval and mining methods are still based on the exact word matching and they use term frequency (word or phrases) as basic measure. It captures the importance of the term in the document but may not capture the original semantics of the term, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To overcome the lack of semantic consideration, a new framework has been introduced which relies on the concept based mining model and semantic based approach. The core part of our model is concept extraction, which perform functions such as document cleaning, parts-of-speech tagging, parsing, term and phrase extraction, feasibility analysis and relation miner. Semantic net and synonym dictionary preserve the semantic relationship in the text document. The dataset used here is ACM abstract articles collected from ACM digital library. Large sets of experiments using the proposed model were conducted and the results demonstrate the accuracy of mining model using semantics preserved concepts, feasibility analysis using singular value decomposition and semantic net representation.

Previous works on music recommendation system focused on the users purchase history or the content of the music. In this paper, we propose a music recommendation system purely based on analyzing textual input of the users. We first mine a large corpus of Korean radio episodes, which is written by the listener. Each episode is composed of a personal story and a song request which we assume to be somehow related to the story. We then performing probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) to find similar documents and recommend music that are associated to those documents. We evaluate our system by computing the mean reciprocal rank and mean average precision, which are both conventional metrics in evaluating information retrieval systems. The result shows that music similarity and document similarity are closely correlated, and thus it is possible to recommend music purely based on text analysis.

The mismatch in the level of abstraction between the natural language representation and the regular expression representation make this a novel and challenging problem. However, a given regular expression can be written in many semantically equivalent forms, and we exploit this flexibility to facilitate translation by finding a form which more directly corresponds to the natural language. We evaluate our technique on a set of natural language queries and their associated regular expressions which we gathered from Amazon Mechanical Turk.

There has been much work on semantic frame parsers, but less that applies them to general NLP problems. We address a task to predict change in stock price from financial news. Semantic frames help to generalize from specific sentences to scenarios, and to detect the (positive or negative) roles of specific companies. We introduce a novel tree representation, and use it to train predictive models with tree kernels using support vector machines. Our experiments test multiple text representations on two binary classification tasks, change of price and polarity. Experiments show that features derived from semantic frame parsing have significantly better performance across years on the polarity task.

The adoption of open data in the e-gov domain produces different advantages in terms of more transparent government, development of better public services, economic growth and social value. However, the process of data opening should adopt standards and open formats. Only in this way it is possible to share experiences with other service providers, to exploit best practices from other cities or countries, and to be easily connected to the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. In this paper we present CroSeR (Cross-language Service Retriever), a tool able to match and retrieve cross-language e-gov services stored in the LOD cloud. The main goal of this work is to help public administrations to connect their e-gov services to services, provided by other administrations, already connected to the LOD cloud. We adopted a Wikipedia-based semantic representation in order to overcome the problems related to match really short textual descriptions associated to the services.

223708;"Hierarchical text classification for supporting educational programs";5;"Ju, Q.a  and Ravagni, C.b  c  and Moschitti, A.a  and Vaschetto, G.b ";"More than two decades have passed since the first design of the CONSTRUE system [2], a powerful rule-based model for the categorization of Reuters news. Nowadays, statistical approaches are well assessed and they allow for an easy design of text classification (TC) systems. Additionally, the Web has emphasized the need of approaches for digesting large amount of textual information and making it more easily accessible, e.g., thorough hierarchical taxonomies like Dmoz or Yahoo! categories. Surprisingly, automated approaches have not proved yet to be indispensable for such categorization processes. This suggests that the role of TC might be different from simply routing documents to different topical categories. In this paper, we provide evidence of the promising use of TC as a support for an interesting and high level human activity in the educational context. The latter refers to the selection and definition of educational programs tailored on specific needs of pupils, who sometime require particular attention and actions to solve their learning problems. TC in this context is exploited to automatically extract several aspects and properties from learning objects, i.e., didactic material, in terms of semantic labels. These can be used to organized the different pieces of material in specific didactic program, which can address specific deficiencies of pupils. The TC experiments, carried out with state-of-the-art algorithms and a small set of training data, show that automatic classifiers can easily derive labels like, didactic context, school matter, pupil difficulties and educative solution type.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";34;"2012";"CEUR Workshop Proceedings";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84892164421&partnerID=40&md5=6b94c2ca07a4fa5ebefad9674dd1daf5";"835";"18-25";;;"02/25/2016";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"28//04/16";"2";"N";"Y";"classificacao semantica";"topicos";"null";"null";"null";"classificacao";"null";"SVM";"accuracy, F1 measure";"Reuters Volume 1";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

We propose a â€œhyperbolic SOMâ€� (HSOM) based on a regular tesselation of the hy-perbolic plane, which is a non-euclidean space characterized by constant negative gaussian curvature. This approach is motivated by the observa-tion that hyperbolic spaces possess a geometry where the size of a neigh-borhood around a point increases exponentially and therefore provides more freedom to map a complex information space such as language into spatial relations. These theoretical findings are supported by our experi-ments, which show that hyperbolic SOMs can successfully be applied to text categorization and yield results comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore we demonstrate that the HSOM is able to map large text collections in a semantically meaningful way and therefore allows a â€œsemantic browsingâ€� of text databases.

224708;"A rough set-based hybrid method to text categorization";5;"Bao, Y.a  and Aoyama, S.a  and Du, X.b  and Yamada, K.a  and Ishii, N.a ";"In this paper we present a hybrid text categorization method based on Rough Sets theory. A central problem in good text classification for information filtering and retrieval (IF/IR) is the high dimensionality of the data. It may contain many unnecessary and irrelevant features. To cope with this problem, we propose a hybrid technique using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Rough Sets theory (RS) to alleviate this situation. Given corpora of documents and a training set of examples of classified documents, the technique locates a minimal set of co-ordinate keywords to distinguish between classes of documents, reducing the dimensionality of the keyword vectors. This simplifies the creation of knowledge-based IF/IR systems, speeds up their operation, and allows easy editing of the rule bases employed. Besides, we generate several knowledge base instead of one knowledge base for the classification of new object, hoping that the combination of answers of the multiple knowledge bases result in better performance. Multiple knowledge bases can be formulated precisely and in a unified way within the framework of RS. This paper describes the proposed technique, discusses the integration of a keyword acquisition algorithm, Latent Semantic indexing (LSI) with Rough Set-based rule generate algorithm, and provides experimental results. The test results show the hybrid method is better than the previous rough set-based approach.

224729;"Multilayered extended semantic networks as a language for meaning representation in NLP systems";5;"Helbig, H. and GnÃ¶rlich, C.";"Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (abbreviated: MultiNet) are one of the few knowledge representation paradigms along the line of Semantic Networks (abbreviated: SN) with a comprehensive, systematic, and publicly available documentation. In contrast to logically oriented meaning representation systems with their extensional interpretation, MultiNet is based on a use-theoretic operational semantics. MultiNet is distinguished from the afore-mentioned systems by fulfilling the criteria of homogeneity and cognitive adequacy. The paper describes the main features of MultiNet and the standard repertoire of representational means provided by this system. Besides of the structural information, which is manifested in the relational and functional connections between nodes of the semantic network, the conceptual representatives of MultiNet are characterized by embedding the nodes of the network into a multidimensional space of layer attributes. To warrant cognitive adequacy and universality of the knowledge representation system, every node of the SN uniquely represents a concept, while the relations between them have to be expressed by a predefined set of about 110 semantic primitive relations and functions. The knowledge representation language MultiNet has been used as an interface in several natural language processing systems. It is also suitable as an interlingua for machine translation systems.

Our experimental results show that both approaches can improve the performance of nearest-neighbor text classification.

224736;"A robust meaning extraction methodology using supervised neural networks";5;"Karras, D.A.a  and Mertzios, B.G.b ";"A large amount of information, stored in intranets and internet databases and accessed through the World-Wide Web, is organized in the form of full-text documents. Efficient retrieval of this information with regards to its meaning and content is an important problem in data mining systems for the creation, management and querying of very large such information bases. In this paper we deal with the main aspect of the problem of extracting meaning from documents, namely, with the problem of text categorization, outlining a novel and systematic approach to its solution. We present a text categorization system for non-domain specific full-text documents based on the learning and generalization capabilities of neural networks. The main contribution of this paper lies on the feature extraction methodology which, first, involves word semantic categories and not raw words as other rival approaches. As a consequence of coping with the problem of dimensionality reduction, the proposed approach introduces a novel second order approach for text categorization feature extraction by considering word semantic categories cooccurrence analysis. The suggested methodology compares favorably to widely accepted, raw word frequency based techniques in a collection of documents concerning the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system. In these comparisons different Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) algorithms as well as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the LVQ and the conventional k-NN technique are involved.

The sheer scale of material has created the pressing need for automated methods of discovering relevant information without having to read it all. Hence the growing interest in recent years in Text Mining. A common approach to Text Mining is Information Extraction (IE), extracting specific types (or templates) of information from a document collection. Although many works on IE have been published, researchers have not paid much attention to evaluate the contribution of syntactic and semantic analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the quality of IE results. In this work we try to quantify the contribution of NLP techniques, by comparing three strategies for IE: naÃ¯ve co-occurrence, ordered co-occurrence, and the structure-driven method - a rule-based strategy that relies on syntactic analysis followed by the extraction of suitable semantic templates. We use the three strategies for the extraction of two templates from financial news stories. We show that the structure-driven strategy provides significantly better precision results than the two other strategies (80-90% for the structure-driven compared with about only 60% for the co-occurrence and ordered co-occurrence). These results indicate that a syntactical and semantic analysis is necessary if one wishes to obtain high accuracy.

224745;"Extracting causation knowledge from natural language texts";5;"Chan, K. and Low, B.-T. and Lam, W. and Lam, K.-P.";"SEKE2 is a semantic expectation-based knowledge extraction system for extracting causation relations from natural language texts. It is inspired by capitalizing the human behavior of analyzing information with semantic expectations. The framework of SEKE2 consists of different kinds of generic templates organized in a hierarchical fashion. All kinds of templates are domain independent. They are robust and enable flexible changes for different domains and expected semantics. By associating a causation semantic template with a set of sentence templates, SEKE2 can extract causation knowledge from complex sentences without full-fledged syntactic parsing. To demonstrate the flexibility of SEKE2 for different domains, we study the application of causation semantic templates on two domain areas of news stories, namely, Hong Kong stock market movement and global warming.

224766;"Discriminative features for document classification";5;"Torkkola, K.";"Document representation using the bag-of-words approach may require bringing the dimensionality of the representation down in order to be able to make effective use of various statistical classification methods. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is one such method that is based on eigendecomposition of the covariance of the document-term matrix. Another often used approach is to select a small number of most important features out of the whole set according to some relevant criterion. This paper points out that LSI ignores discrimination while concentrating on representation. Furthermore, selection methods fail to produce a feature set that jointly optimizes class discrimination. As a remedy, we suggest supervised linear discriminative transforms, and report good classification results applying these to the Reuters-21578 database.

224777;"Language resources in the semantic web vision";5;"Calzolari, N.";"Computational lexicons will undoubtedly form an essential component to make the vision of the Semantic Web a reality. In the Semantic Web scenario, ontologies are the key components to manage knowledge, whereas, in Human Language Technology (HLT), semantic description is committed to computational lexicons, which have to address the complexity of natural language. Language - and lexicons - are the gateway to knowledge: only through them can we tackle the twofold challenge of digital content availability and multilinguality. Aiming at making word content machine-understandable, computational lexicons intend to provide an explicit representation of word meaning, so that it can be directly accessed and used by computational agents, such as large-coverage parsers, modules for intelligent Information Retrieval or Information Extraction, etc In all these cases, semantic information is necessary to enhance the performance of Natural Language Processing tools, and to achieve a real understanding of text content. Moreover, in multilingual computational lexicons we find the linguistic (morpho-syntactic/seniantic) information necessary to establish links among words of different languages, information of great importance for systems performing multilingual text processing, such as Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, etc. Semantic content processing lies at the heart of the Semantic Web vision. Semantic Web developers will therefore need very large repositories of words and terms - and knowledge about their relations. The cost of adding this structured and machine-understandable lexical information can be one of the factors that delays Semantic Web full deployment. A natural convergence thus exists between some of the core activities in the field of HLT and the Semantic Web long-term goals. In the last decade so-called language resources (LRs) (both lexicons and corpora, but also grammars and basic and robust software components) have been unanimously recognised as a necessary preliminary platfonn for developing an adequate HLT [3]. Large scale LRs are therefore considered as the infrastructure underlying language technology. If we broaden our perspective into the future, it is clear that the need of ever growing LRs makes it necessary to propose and promote a change in the paradigm. A radical shift in the lexical paradigm -whereby many participants add linguistic content descriptions in an open distributed and collaborative language framework - is required and proposed to make the Web usable. Existing experience in LR development proves that such a challenge can be tackled only by pursuing a truly interdisciplinary approach, and by establishing a highly advanced environment for the representation and acquisition of lexical information, open to the reuse and interchange of lexical data. As a prerequisite to enable this open language infrastructure two key issues are: (i) standards, which are critical to achieve interoperability and integration; (ii) content, which must be dealt with in a multilingual environment and in a dynamic approach. Answers to the two issues are found within two frameworks: (i) in the context of the ISLE [2] enterprise (http://lingue.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/isle/ISLE-Home-Page.htm) which, with the. definition of MILE (Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry), represents an interface between advanced research in multilingual lexical semantics and the practical task of developing resources for HLT; (ii) in lexicon models diat account for the complex, multidimensional and multifaceted nature of meaning in lexicon and ontology design, and can accommodate dynamically acquired infonnation. The reuse of existing lexicons - and the sharing of lexical resources in general - is achieved through the design of MILE [1], a lexical schema which (i) takes into consideration the basic notions employed in major available lexicons, (ii) is flexible enough to allow mapping from various lexical models into it, and (iii) allows the creation of user defined lexical objects if needed. The multidimensional perspective is one of die peculiar feaUires of the ISLE activities, and contributes to its added value with respect to other current standardisation initiatives. Ulis way, ISLE intends, on the one hand, to answer to the need of fostering die reuse and interchange of existing lexical resources and, on the other hand, to enhance the. technological transfer from advanced research to applications. It also prepares the ground for a ""new generation"" of ""knowledge resources"". Moreover, computational lexicons should be conceived as dynamic systems, whose development needs to be complemented with the automatic acquisition of semantic information from texts. Gaining insights into die deep interrelation between representation and acquisition issues is likely to have significant repercussions on the way linguistic resources will be designed, developed and used for applications in die years to come. As the two aspects of knowledge representation and acquisition are profoundly interrelated, progress on botii fronts can only be achieved through a full appreciation of this deep interdependency. The proposed open and distributed language infrastructure must be able to simultaneously tackle the following aspects: the design of advanced architectures for the representation of lexical content; the development of new methods and techniques for die automatic acquisition of semantic knowledge from texts and for the customization and update of lexical resources; the standardization of various aspects of the lexicon, up to content interoperability standards. Some of the prerequisites of this new lexical framework are: open framework, where everyone must be able to access, put new information, get parts of the lexicons; multilingual, multimodal, multimedial, dynamic, i.e. comprising tools for acquiring information from texts (e.g. the web); integrative, allowing the integration into different environments and enabling an interaction between different types of LRs (e.g. corpus and lexicon); knowledge intensive, allowing representation of rich semantic infonnation, and bootstrapping new semantic information starting from the available one. Coming from the experience gathered in developing advanced lexicon models such as the SIMPLE one [4], and along die lines pursued by the ISLE standardisation process, a new generation of lexical resources can be envisaged. These will cnicially provide die semantic information necessary to allow for effective content processing. On the outer hand, they will in turn benefit from the Semantic Web itself. Thus, it is possible to state the existence of a bidirectional relation between the Semantic Web enterprise and computational lexicon design and construction. In fact, the Semantic Web is going to crucially determine the shape of die language resources of the future. Semantic Web emerging standards, such as ontologies, RDF, etc., allow for a new approach to language resource development and maintenance, which is consistent with the vision of an open space of sharable knowledge available on the Web for processing. We claim that it is feasible and timely - and indeed critically needed - to set up a very large world-wide initiative, within which a large group of lexicon experts/providers is a core component. This initiative must build prominently on existing or fumre (possibly national) (http://www.enabler-network.org/index.htm) lexical initiatives, and integrate along this dimension the human R&D resources coming from both the communities of HLT and Semantic Web.

224778;"Ontology based semantic similarity comparison of documents";5;"Oleshchuk, V.a  and Pedersen, A.b ";"In this paper, we consider ontologies as knowledge structures that specify terms, their properties and relations among them to enable knowledge extraction from texts. We represent ontologies using a graph-based model that reflect semantic relationship between concepts and apply them to text analysis and comparison. Instead of raw document comparison we compare document footprint enhanced with concepts from the ontology (using different enhancement algorithms). The result of this process may be that documents not similar prior to the enhancement become similar (semantically on some abstraction level) after the enhancement. This is because the enhancement process may introduce in the document footprint abstract concepts from the ontology. Using the ontology we can enhance the foot-prints by adding concepts that are not present in the original document. We may use synonyms for a horizontal expansion and broader terms/superclasses/types in a vertical expansion or both for that matter.

The underlying framework is latent semantic analysis: each e-maii is automatically classified against two semantic anchors, one for legitimate and one for junk messages. Experiments show that this approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art in e-mail classification, and potentially advantageous in real-world applications with high junk-to-legitimate ratios.

We report experiments on text classification of the Cora and WebKB data sets using Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis and Probabilistic Hypertext Induced Topic Selection. Comparison with manually assigned classes shows that link information enhances classification in data with sufficiently high link density, but is detrimental to performance at low link densities or if the quality of the links is degraded.

224843;"Logic programming infrastructure for inferences on FrameNet";5;"Baumgartner, P.a  and Burchardt, A.b ";"The growing size of electronically available text corpora like companies intranets or the WWW has made information access a hot topic within Computational Linguistics. Despite the success of statistical or keyword based methods, deeper Knowledge Representation (KR) techniques along with ""inference"" are often mentioned as mandatory, e.g. within the Semantic Web context, to enable e.g. better query answering based on ""semantical"" information. In this paper we try to contribute to the open question how to operationalize semantic information on a larger scale. As a basis we take the frame structures of the Berkeley FrameNet II project, which is a structured dictionary to explain the meaning of words from a lexicographic perspective. Our main contribution is a transformation of the FrameNet II frames into the answer set programming paradigm of logic programming. Because a number of different reasoning tasks are subsumed under ""inference"" in the context of natural language processing, we emphasize the flexibility of our transformation. Together with methods for automatic annotation of text documents with frame semantics which are currently developed at various sites, we arrive at an infrastructure that supports experimentation with semantic information access as is currently demanded for.

224879;"Extracting semantic categories of nouns for syntactic disambiguation from human-oriented explanatory dictionaries";5;"Calvo, H.a  and Gelbukh, A.a  b ";"Syntactic disambiguation frequently requires knowledge of the semantic categories of nouns, especially in languages with free word order. For example, in Spanish the phrases pintÃ³ un cuadro un pintor (lit. painted a picture a painter) and pintÃ³ un pintor un cuadro (lit. painted a painter a picture) mean the same: a painter painted a picture. The only way to tell the subject from the object is by knowing that pintor painter is a causal agent and cuadro is a thing. We present a method for extracting semantic information of this kind from existing machine-readable human-oriented explanatory dictionaries. Application of this procedure to two different human-oriented Spanish dictionaries gives additional information as compared with using solely Spanish EuroWordNet.

224903;"The impact of enriched linguistic annotation on the performance of extracting relation triples";5;"Kim, S. and Lewis, P. and Martinez, K.";"A relation extraction system recognises pre-defined relation types between two identified entities from natural language documents. It is important for a task of automatically locating missing instances in knowledge base where the instance is represented as a triple (entity - relation - entity). A relation entry specifies a set of rules associated with the syntactic and semantic conditions under which appropriate relations would be extracted. Manually creating such rules requires knowledge from information experts and moreover, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task when the input sentences have little consistency in terms of structures and vocabularies. In this paper, we present an approach for applying a symbolic learning algorithm to sentences in order to automatically induce the extraction rules which then successfully classify a new sentence. The proposed approach takes into account semantic attributes (e.g., semantically close words and named-entities) in generalising common patterns among the sentences which enable the system to cope better with syntactically different but semantically similar sentences. Not only does this increase the number of relations extracted, but it also improves the accuracy in extracting relations by adding features which might not be discovered only with syntactic analysis. Experimental results show that this approach is effective on the sentences of the Web documents obtaining 17% higher precision and 34% higher recall values.

224904;"Predictive top-down knowledge improves neural exploratory bottom-up clustering";5;"Hung, C.a  b  and Wermter, S.a  and Smith, P.a ";"In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that integrating symbolic top-down knowledge into text vector representations can improve neural exploratory bottom-up representations for text clustering. By extracting semantic rules from WordNet, terms with similar concepts are substituted with a more general term, the hypemym. This hypemym semantic relationship supplements the neural model in document clustering. The neural model is based on the extended significance vector representation approach into which predictive top-down knowledge is embedded. When we examine our hypothesis by six competitive neural models, the results are consistent and demonstrate that our robust hybrid neural approach is able to improve classification accuracy and reduce the average quantization error on 100,000 full-text articles.

224906;"CRISOL: An approach for automatically populating semantic web from unstructured text collections";5;"Danger, R.a  and Berlanga, R.b  and RuÃ­z-Shulcloper, J.c ";"Currently, the main drawback for the development of the Semantic Web stems from the manual tagging of web pages according to a given ontology that conceptualizes its domain. This tasks is usually hard, even for experts, and it is prone to errors due to the different interpretations users can have about the same documents. In this paper we address the problem of automatically generating ontology instances starting from a collection of unstructured documents (e.g. plain texts, HTML pages, etc.). These instances will populate the Semantic Web that is described by the ontology. The proposed approach combines Information Extraction techniques, mainly entity recognition, information merging and Text Mining techniques. This approach has been successfully applied in the development of a Semantic Web for the Archaeology Research.

This paper describes the work of Alicante 1 group. We have continued with the research line established in the past competition, where the main goal was to obtain a fully data-driven system based on machine learning techniques. Last year an XML framework was established in order to obtain a modular system where each component could be easily replaced or upgraded. In this framework, a question classification system based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and surface text features was included, achieving remarkable performance in this stage. The main novelties introduced this year are focused on the information retrieval stage. First, we employed Indri as our search engine for passage retrieval. Secondly, we developed a module for passage re-ranking based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). This technique provides a method for determining the similarity of meaning between words by analysis of large text corpora. In our experiments, every question was compared with every passage returned by the search engine by means of LSA in order to re-rank them. Looking at the results, this technique increased the retrieval accuracy for definition questions but it decreased accuracy on factoid ones. To take advantage of the flexibility and adaptability of our machine learning based proposal, this year we extended our participation to monolingual Spanish task and bilingual Spanish-English task. We reach a best overall accuracy of 29.47% in the first task and 20.00% in the second one.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";12;"2006";"CEUR Workshop Proceedings";;"Conference Paper";;"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84922022249&partnerID=40&md5=44d3f343861204389fdf659dc38fe5eb";"1172";;;;"02/25/2016";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"28/04/16";"2";"N";"Y";"rank dos resultados";"null";"null";"null";"null";"classificacao";"null";"LSA, SVM";"accuracy";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

The representation of biomedical knowledge has been found of great use for biomedical text mining and integration of biomedical data. In this chapter we present an unsupervised method for learning arbitrary semantic relations between ontological concepts in the molecular biology domain. The method uses the GENIA corpus and ontology to learn relations between annotated named-entities by means of several standard natural language processing techniques. An in-depth analysis of the output evaluates the accuracy of the model and its potentials for text mining and ontology building applications. The proposed learning method does not require domain-specific optimization or tuning and can be straightforwardly applied to arbitrary domains, provided the basic processing components exist.

The visualisation method involves a process of non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), to uncover topics in an essay, followed by multidimensional scaling, to map the essay topics to a 2-dimensional representation.

There are a lot of semantic similarity measures for addressing this problem. However, the best results have been achieved when aggregating a number of simple similarity measures. This means that after the various similarity values have been calculated, the overall similarity for a pair of text expressions is computed using an aggregation function of these individual semantic similarity values. This aggregation is often computed by means of statistical functions.

261136;"A journey from normative to behavioral operations in supply chain management: A review using Latent Semantic Analysis ";7;"Anirban Kundu and Vipul Jain and Sameer Kumar and Charu Chandra";"Abstract This study aims to systematically review the cross disciplinary literature covering the time period from 1934 to January 2013 on behavioral operations in supply chain in order to identify and define the taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. A list of noted journals and search results from Science Direct and Web of Knowledge, \{IEEE\} Xplore, and \{INFORMS\} (approximately 11,000 journal articles) is used to prepare content collection. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is applied as the review and knowledge extraction methodology. Using the text analysis and mining method we can combine statistical methods and expert human judgment to extract knowledge in the form of key latent factors. The \{LSA\} based analysis gives the study a scientific grounding which helps to overcome the subjectivity of collective opinion about the trends. This approach allows proposing taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. The adopted systems approach is used to find research gaps in each class of taxonomy. An emerging trend is noticed in the research of behavioral operations in supply chain. Understanding such a scholarly structure and future trends will assist researchers to assimilate the divergent developments of this multidisciplinary research in one place. This review will be beneficial for practitioners as they consider behavioral aspects in decision making.

261143;"Quantitative cross impact analysis with latent semantic indexing ";7;"Dirk Thorleuchter and Dirk Van den Poel";"Abstract Cross impact analysis (CIA) consists of a set of related methodologies that predict the occurrence probability of a specific event and that also predict the conditional probability of a first event given a second event. The conditional probability can be interpreted as the impact of the second event on the first. Most of the \{CIA\} methodologies are qualitative that means the occurrence and conditional probabilities are calculated based on estimations of human experts. In recent years, an increased number of quantitative methodologies can be seen that use a large number of data from databases and the internet. Nearly 80% of all data available in the internet are textual information and thus, knowledge structure based approaches on textual information for calculating the conditional probabilities are proposed in literature. In contrast to related methodologies, this work proposes a new quantitative \{CIA\} methodology to predict the conditional probability based on the semantic structure of given textual information. Latent semantic indexing is used to identify the hidden semantic patterns standing behind an event and to calculate the impact of the patterns on other semantic textual patterns representing a different event. This enables to calculate the conditional probabilities semantically. A case study shows that this semantic approach can be used to predict the conditional probability of a technology on a different technology.

261144;"Arabic web pages clustering and annotation using semantic class features ";7;"Hanan M. Alghamdi and Ali Selamat and Nor Shahriza Abdul Karim";"Abstract To effectively manage the great amount of data on Arabic web pages and to enable the classification of relevant information are very important research problems. Studies on sentiment text mining have been very limited in the Arabic language because they need to involve deep semantic processing. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to retrieve machine-understandable data with the help of a Web content mining technique to detect covert knowledge within these data. We propose an approach to achieve clustering with semantic similarities. This approach comprises integrating k-means document clustering with semantic feature extraction and document vectorization to group Arabic web pages according to semantic similarities and then show the semantic annotation. The document vectorization helps to transform text documents into a semantic class probability distribution or semantic class density. To reach semantic similarities, the approach extracts the semantic class features and integrates them into the similarity weighting schema. The quality of the clustering result has evaluated the use of the purity and the mean intra-cluster distance (MICD) evaluation measures. We have evaluated the proposed approach on a set of common Arabic news web pages. We have acquired favorable clustering results that are effective in minimizing the MICD, expanding the purity and lowering the runtime.

273069;"Fast Text Classification Using Randomized Explicit Semantic Analysis";8;"A. Musaev and De Wang and S. Shridhar and C. Pu";"Document classification or document categorization is one of the most studied areas in computer science due to its importance. The problem is to assign a document using its text to one or more classes or categories from a predefined set. We propose a new approach for fast text classification using randomized explicit semantic analysis (RS-ESA). It is based on a state of the art approach for word sense disambiguation based on Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia in existence. Our method reduces Wikipedia repository using a random sample approach resulting in a throughput, which is an order of magnitude faster than the original explicit semantic analysis. RS-ESA approach has been implemented as part of the LITMUS project due to a need in classifying data from Social Media into relevant and irrelevant items with respect to landslide as a natural disaster. We demonstrate that our approach achieves 96% precision when classifying Social Media landslide data collected in December 2014. We also demonstrate the genericity of the proposed approach by using it for separating factual texts from fictional based on Wikipedia articles and fan fiction stories, where we achieve 97% in precision.";"ACCEPTED";"ACCEPTED";"LOW";57;"2015";"Information Reuse and Integration (IRI), 2015 IEEE International Conference on";"natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis;RS-ESA;Wikipedia;document categorization;document classification;randomized explicit semantic analysis;social media;text classification;word sense disambiguation;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet;Media;Terrain factors;Training;event detection;explicit semantic analysis;social media;text classification";;;"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7301000  ";;"364-371";"10.1109/IRI.2015.62";;"02/25/2016";;"N";"N";"N";"N";"N";;"01/05/16";"2";"N";"Y";"classificacao semantica";"null";"null";"wikipedia";"null";"classificacao";"null";"null";"Precision";"null";"null";"null";"null";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"N";"N";"N";"N";"null";"Y";"N";"null";"null"

Word2vec offers a unique perspective to the text mining community. By converting words and phrases into a vector representation, word2vec takes an entirely new approach on text classification. Based on the assumption that word2vec brings extra semantic features that helps in text classification, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of word2vec by showing that tf-idf and word2vec combined can outperform tf-idf because word2vec provides complementary features (e.g. semantics that tf-idf cant capture) to tf-idf. Our results show that the combination of word2vec weighted by tf-idf and tf-idf does not outperform tf-idf consistently.

273141;"A new text representation model enriched with semantic relations";8;"A. Nugumanova and Y. Baiburin and K.

We use singular value decomposition of the co-occurrence matrix to overcome its noise and sparseness. Thereby, we obtain a new refined co-occurrence matrix, which allows us to determine relations between words as distances in it. We use these distances as correction factors for the Bag-of-words text representation. In other words, we transform text representation vectors by inclusion relations between words. To validate our representation model, we apply it to binary classification task. We study how our model improves classification of documents, which are relevant to a given domain (topic).

These concepts can explain the patterns meanings in a human understandable way while improving the information filtering performance. The model is evaluated by comparing it against one state-of-the-art benchmark model using standard Reuters dataset. The results show that the proposed model is successful. The significance of this model is three fold.
