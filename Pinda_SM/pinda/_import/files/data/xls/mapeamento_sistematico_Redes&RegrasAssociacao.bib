  review = {Problem: The Frequent Connected Subgraph mining on a set of graphs
	is widely used on the literature. One of its use is the frequent
	pattern mining. The major problem in this approach is the number
	of duplicated patterns that are found. To avoid the duplication,
	several algorithms were proposed to compare and find only new patterns
	(so called canonical). The canonical subgraphs mining is a very complex
	process that includes a lot of comparation between graphs.
	
	
	Proposed Solution: Uses a pattern growth approach to mine subgraphs
	based on the minimality condition
	
	
	Conclusion: The proposed algorithm (gRed) sucessfully reduced the
	amount of generated candidates also reducing the amount of time to
	run.

	The pattern extraction uses the Poisson correlation, based on a informed

	Proposed Solution: They proposed the weighted interaction flow directed

	First, all the possible interactions are modeled to reduce the domain,
	which means that every interaction taken in the meeting is classified

	Proposed Solution: They proposed a pattern growth approach that walks
	on the graph. To prevent duplicated patterns, they calculate a symmetry
	measure while expanding the patterns, so the process can stop and
	take other path instead of generating a already discovered pattern.
	To consider multiple minimum suppport and different items importances,
	the support is not calculated over the conventional item appearance,
	instead, it is calculated using the edges' weights . This allows
	differents support values and differents importances on edges.

	Proposed Solution: They proposed a network where each vertex is a

	2 uses association rules to find the relationship among differents

	on that measure, the authors generate a graph. This graph has a property
	that, if you find a maximum cycle (a cycle of vertices that you discover
